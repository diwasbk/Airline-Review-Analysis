Boeing 787,Xiamen Airlines,Business Class,November 2018,4th December 2018,2,3,1,UnitedStates,2.0,no,"Seattle to Manila via Xiamen. My wife and I planned a trip to the Philippines from Seattle and decided upon Xiamen Airlines Business Class. The routing was Seattle, Shenzen, Xiamen and Manila. We traveled late October 2018. The seating configuration in the Boeing 787, Business Class was 2-2-2. The seats were lay flat for sleeping, but unfortunately were leatherette covered which meant one would slide forward when seated upright due to the slippery covering. Lunch was served and I chose duck. This was the consistency of rubber and virtually inedible. The 12.5 hour flight was uneventful, however during this time the cabin staff barely checked on us. When they did, there was a distinct language problem. We couldn't understand them and they couldn't understand us! One would think when one is on a international flight a common understandable language should be used. When we arrived at Shenzen we had a layover of 2 hours during which time we had to clear Chinese Customs and Immigration. After this we had to wait in a departure lounge without being told anything about our next flight leg. There were about 12 onward passengers waiting for the next leg. Eventually we were told our boarding gate and ETD. The flight to Xiamen was around 1 hour. After arrival we had to pick up our luggage and we went to the Xiamen Airlines counter to get a hotel voucher as we had 20 hour layover. Xiamen Airlines to not have a hotel bus or any means to transport us to the hotel. We had to change money to get a taxi. This was an effort in its own right. We did leave some of our baggage at the left luggage office at the airport, which helped. The next day we caught a taxi back to the airport. We go through security on entry to the airport before checking in for our flight to Manila. I should mention that boarding to Manila like the short leg for Shenzen was chaos. No boarding by class or seating, just go for it! Service on board was almost like a domestic flight, again a language problem. We arrive in Manila after almost 36 hours after leaving Seattle. It was nice to experience the friendliness of Philippine Customs and Immigration. The return from Manila to Seattle every bit as bad as when we arrived late (11:30pm) in Xiamen we had to clear customs and immigration and by the time that happened it was around 2am banks were closed and we had now money for a taxi to the hotel we finally change $20 with a Xiamen Airline staff member and got to the hotel around 2:30 am. We were again routed via Shenzen and had to go through immigration and carry ALL bags through security. The flight back was slightly better, but there was still the language barrier. All in all the Xiamen Airlines experience was poor. The airline should make sure the cabin staff have sufficient English to carry out a basic conversation. The airline should upgrade all staff to a level of what is expected from a good international airline.

Boeing 737-800 / 787-8 ,Xiamen Airlines,Economy Class,November 2018,3rd December 2018,4,4,3,Singapore,8.0,yes,"Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen. Note that my rating here is for XMN-YVR, not considering SIN-XMN, and not taking into account the visa issues at XMN. If you are not a holder of one of the 53 countries' passports that qualify for visa exemption by the Chinese government, then you need to apply for a visa before flying. XMN does not offer visa services at the airport. The main reason for the need of a visa is, XMN does not have a usual transit arrangement, which usually doesn't require you to go through immigration. At XMN, in order to transit, you have to go through immigration, which means you are entering China and then leaving China officially, just to transit between flights. This is why people transiting with passports that do not qualify for visa exemption have to apply for visa. If you are unsure, please make sure you email your local Xiamen Air representatives to check. Regarding SIN-XMN, it was below average. It was an older aircraft, without individual IFE system. The stewardesses were willing to help and respond to demands, but they were typically brisk and curt with their responses. Food was okay, not remarkable. XMN-YVR was excellent. The economy seat was comfortable, and leg room was good. Food was excellent and more than sufficient. In fact, the stewardesses made rounds between meals to ask if people wanted snacks, like bread rolls, sandwiches, or peanuts. The stewardesses were very friendly and approachable, very willing to help the passengers. It is unfortunate that their command of the English language is below average, but if you speak Mandarin, then you are fine. All in, it was an excellent flight at a very cheap price. I think, if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's Boeing 787, then there is a good chance that your flight will be a very good one. But if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's older aircraft, then you may not get to experience the better side of the airline. Finally, there is no online check-in services for international flights for Xiamen Air. You can choose your seats only if you spend some money. Otherwise, you have to request for your seat at the counter at the airport.

We booked this airline because 3 of us could go round trip for the price of 1 major carrier! Such a deal - R/T LAX to ICN (Seoul Korea) for $450 per person!  If you are not Asian or don't like Asian food - please pack your own food. Found this airline to be just as professional, efficient, and friendly to fly with. Our flight did have to go thru 2 Chinese ports of entry (Qingdao & Xiamen). The flight was very comfortable due to the new airplane (Boeing 787-9). I noticed the increased air pressure (6000 ft elevation) and increased humidity did not dry me out and felt good at the end of 14 hours in flight. The flight staff was very courteous, attentive, and tried their best with English but Google translate came in handy to communicate. Wifi was available but not very good - too many people using it and not enough bandwidth for streaming. Food was good - 2 hot meals and 2 cold snacks in-between kept you full and satisfied. Very Chinese cuisines on all 4 legs of the flight (2 international, 2 domestic). Just remember, the airline is Chinese and therefore will serve Chinese food - don't expect Panda Express type food like the US. The food is primarily pork based with some fish, chicken or beef offering. If you elect vegetarian or muslim or any other special needs food, make sure you request this 24 hours before your flight. I saw some western folks unhappy with seeing unfamiliar Chinese food being served on a Chinese airline - I had to chuckle watching them eat the bread and desert for their meals. The only issue which is not the airline's fault was going thru Chinese immigration. We did not have a Chinese visa which is normally required for landing in China, but 50+ countries can ""transit"" thru China if you can prove your final destination is outside of China. The government issues a temporary transit visa for those that are going thru the country - it's good for 24 hours. At our 2 hr layover for refueling, Qingdao was the worst - they scrutinized and held up the entire non Chinese group of passengers looking for errors & past problems. They pulled 2 passengers out of the group for failing to register with a local Chinese police agency the last time they were in China. Military uniformed people surrounded them making you feel like you are in a communist country.... The airline staff was very good at preparing you for Chinese immigration - having your itinerary with you, boarding pass with correct name spelled, etc. Landing at Xiamen was much easier and nicer immigration folks. We even had time to visit the First class airport lounge using our Amex Plat card. Return trip was good and we even had an overnight layover and the airline provided a hotel for the night at no cost which was nice. We did have to pay the taxi rides both ways so remember to bring some Chinese Yuan (RMB) currency. We got to also go on a tour of the city on a double decker sightseeing bus that took us all around the perimeter of the island.

I have never taken the time to write a negative review in my life. Call me old fashioned, but I just do not care enough to complain online for other people to read. I booked a one way return flight on Xiamen a week or so ago from Manila to LAX with two layovers in China. I have flown with China Eastern, China Southern, Air China and China Airlines, so I thought nothing of it. Another pass through China and I would be in Los Angeles for my mothers birthday on the 16th. Upon arriving to the airport 2 hours early and checking in I was notified I could not board my flight because I didn't have proper clearance. I explained to the rep that I had no plans of entering CHINA and would only be passing through. Still not allowed. I explained I had been through China 4 times on layovers and never had an issue. Still not allowed. Long story short it took two hours arguing for the airlines to agree to a 30-60 day refund. It turns out Americans cant connect through their layover city so they are selling tickets that are unusable. No compensation. Just blank faced souless stares.

MF852,Xiamen Airlines,Economy Class,December 2017,21st December 2017,0,0,0,Singapore,1.0,no,I booked my flight using eDreams from Singapore to Los Angeles via Xiamen and the ticket I got was as follows Singapore to Los Angeles via Xiamen (Layover 2h 35mins) Los Angeles to Singapore United (Direct Flight). I hold a valid USA visa and thus was all set to board the flight. When I reached the airport at the counter I was told by the staff that in order to take the Xiamen flight I need to have a China Visa (There is some rule where people from 7 countries in the world need to do when transiting via Xiamen). I asked the airline staff that I was not given any prompt at the time of booking nor is any such requirement mentioned on Xiamen website and on the internet however I was not helped. In order to not spoil my families vacation I bought a one way ticket to USA on another airline. I was not reimbursed for my original ticket let alone any compensation for my new booking. I've been contacting Xiamen Airlines about why is this rule not mentioned on their website as it is such a unique requirement however they're unable to respond to me properly. In their defence they're quoting the requirement of need of a visa for China for people from all over the world except for 51 specific countries if you want to transit for less than 3 days however my case is different. I just had a layover of 2 hour and 35 minutes.

Boeing 787 / A321,Xiamen Airlines,Economy Class,November 2017,22nd November 2017,3,3,2,UnitedStates,6.0,yes,"Los Angeles to Bangkok via Xiamen. It was not the overly-friendly skies, especially on the shorter flight, but the snacks, food and beverage were OK. Another review reminded me of the barely audible English announcements (use headphones to hear it). The seats and legroom seem average. The Boeing 787 for the LAX-XMN segment is a nice, new aircraft. The entertainment system had a small selection of music and movies, which were adequate. Emirates scores better there! The website is hard to use, and changes seemed impossible. But I successfully purchased a ticket. If I purchased again, I would be certain everything is perfect before clicking Submit. I'm hesitant to call ""customer service"" as English is not their main language, and rules over customer satisfaction seem to be the situation. The worst part of the flight was the layover in Xiamen, China. Border control entry is required, followed by departure control. This is slow and time consuming. Re-entering security is very strict. Every passenger is wanded after passing the magnetometers. My baggage scan revealed two small Bic lighters, which were confiscated. Any lithium batteries in checked bags are likely to be removed. The airport is years behind many International airports, and is hard to spend time in. However, long layovers can qualify you for a hotel room (+5 hours), a city tour, or the lounge on the lowest level - with free Wi-Fi. The lounge was quite basic and drab. Hard to call it a ""benefit"". A room in the back had cots. In the airport, I was twice offered working iPhones for cash. With a landing announcement that mentions contacting quarantine if you're ill, including headaches, nausea or diarrhea, and the scrutiny upon entry and exit, I don't advise buying black market iPhones. The ticket price was very competitive.

Boarding the aircraft, the first thing I noticed was the 737-800's aisle was very narrow. The aircraft was showing wear. I noticed the seats had ashtrays! And the two-plug receptacles for headphones (however, no inflight entertainment was offered). How old was this aircraft? That said, there was more legroom than I expected, so it was not too uncomfortable. The seat only had an airline safety card -- no magazine and no air-sickness bags (They distributed air-sickness bags to people on landing approach.) The flight left a few minutes late. When airborne, a sandwich was served. Bland chicken and cheese. When I asked for some water after the beverage service had passed, the unfriendly flight attendant acted as if I had asked for the world. The flight was relatively uneventful until the end. Our approach to Sochi was during clear skies, yet the landing was rough ... right wheel first, the left, then a hard nose down. Passengers let out a gasp as we shuddered down the runway before the pilot smoothed out our landing. I wonder if because of the age of the aircraft that it was lacking the ""state of the art"" avionics that most aircraft have which make such landings rare nowadays. I fly relatively frequently and it has been a long time since I had such a landing. In the end, we made it safely. For a national/regional mid-to-small airline I would rank it as average.

Boeing 787-8,ZIPAIR,Economy Class,April 2023,28th April 2023,0,5,5,UnitedStates,9.0,yes,"First off, I’m not a picky flyer by any means. I only get up from my seat to stretch occasionally and always bring my own entertainment options, no matter what is offered in-flight. I don’t need a lot of space or amenities to be content, even though I’m not a small guy. That was the initial attraction to ZIPAIR for me, not paying for things I wasn’t going to use. Entertainment? Bring your own (every seat has a USB-A charging port and they allow power banks, so don’t sweat the electrons). Meals, snacks, and drinks? Offered, but must be paid for separately either before you board, or in-flight via a browser interface using the plane’s WiFi system. Honestly, fine with me. I brought my own snacks and water on board, and used WiFi to order some drinks. The flights were incredibly smooth, the cabin staff were a vision of professionalism and care, the planes were spotless, and the seat comfort was better than expected despite being in Economy. For that matter, buying the tickets through the simple website was a breeze, check-in at the airports took less than 5 minutes, and because I kept my baggage simple, the tickets were vastly less expensive than other options. My only gripes were cabin temperatures - for some reason the cabin felt just a bit stifling both to and fro, and the air vents were on the anemic side - and the WiFi was a bit spotty. Honestly, these are relatively minor complaints (especially WiFi, hardly a necessity), and I feel these in no way diminished the value of what I saved on my fare.

Dreamliner,ZIPAIR,Business Class,May 2022,23rd May 2022,2,3,1,Japan,6.0,yes,"Zipair is JAL’s budget airline. They don’t have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we aren’t used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you can’t pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we weren’t allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldn’t even change seats on board although the seat on my husband’s left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you can’t buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing. There wasn’t enough meal/entertainment/shopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping.

This is not a complaint about the lack of free meals or in-flight entertainment. I know how so-called low cost airlines operate and have never had a problem with any of them until my partner and I tried to fly WOW for the first (and last) time. This is a complaint about the treatment we received and the fees we were charged at the gate of our flight WW447 AMS-KEF, on the date of September 3 at AMS (Schiphol) airport. We booked our WOW air flights months in advance of our flight measured our bags, which fit perfectly within the very restrictive WOW measurements. We have photographs to prove that the bags fit into the bags measurement frame placed at WOW gates. Prior to our flight we checked in online and received boarding passes into email, that was not a problem. However, at the gate of our flight from AMS to KEF we were stopped impolitely by an individual from WOW ground personnel, who started insisting that our bags were carry-ons just because they had 2 wheels, and that we had to pay in order to get them on the plane. She would not even look at my original ticket, where the definition of included luggage only showed dimensions and had in no way specified that included luggage could not have wheels. She never measured the bags, nor weighed them, nothing, just insisted that ""wheels"" cannot be placed under seats due to ""safety."" This individual further refused to provide her name and also prohibited me from taking a photo of her ID for evidence, repeating multiple times that it is not allowed. Every question I tried to ask she dismissed with It is not allowed, to the point that I felt I was talking to a robot. I tried to show her the original ticket on my phone, but she refused to have any human communication or reasoning with me, and kept repeating it is not allowed. When I asked to see a supervisor, she replied, it is not allowed to have a supervisor, after which she moved us to the side and said we were not getting on the flight at all. We had to wait until the entire plane was boarded, when she sent a colleague of hers, who likewise insisted that our small bags were trolleys and were not allowed on the flight for free due to safety. I tried to explain that my original ticket showed no such prohibition whatsoever, but she insisted we had to pay or we could not fly. We absolutely felt blackmailed, humiliated and ended up profoundly disturbed They charged us 160 Euro for our two bags, as we were taking a connect flight to Detroit later that afternoon from Reykjavik, and only then were we allowed to board the flight. Once we paid, however, we were told that we could place our bags wherever we chose, and when I said that the entire affair was not about safety but about paying, they had no response, because this is what it was all about – extorting money from travelers.  If the company wants to prohibit the use of wheeled luggage, it must define the included luggage as such excluding wheels, otherwise am free to interpret the shape or pattern of the luggage freely, as long as it complies with the measurements, which it did.

At least 30 mins late, but my last plane was 2 hours late. The flights are quite stable in being late, so usually being late for the same time. Eat just before flight and buy a bottle of water just before flight. Usually you can do this in airport just before flight, but if late-evening flight (after 22:00), then it make sense to eat before entering airport. 3. Come to Wow air registration anyway (even if you printed boarding passes in advance), so they would print new boarding passes for you. This can prevent some issues. Do not rely on anything to be on-time. For example, I bought 12:30 Gold Ring tour on plane (being sure that flight arrives at 11:00 and then enough time to be at 12:30 to BSI-terminal for taking this tour), but actually plane arrived at 11:12AM and then bus arrived at 12:34, so I was 4 mins late for the tour (and I've seen the tour bus going away trying wave my hands to driver, but it didn't help). As result, lost the 60USD ticket for tour and didn't see Gold Ring that I wanted during flight connections. Better to take rent-car after the flight (because even if flight 2 hours late, you could still take rent car, but this doesn't apply to buses or even could be worse if next-connection-other-companies-flight). This is not about Wow air, but just about Keflavik airport flight-connections during night. During my way back, I had a night in airport. I didn't reserve any hotel. I had a boarding pass in advance and did some walking in Reykjavik during day-time (latest Flybus from BSI-terminal to airport at 20:00), so first I did some walking around outside airport during the evening and then entered at 23:30 the boarding zone without any problems. Then slept about from 00:15 to 4:30. The border (for zone D) closed during night hours, but still if having boarding pass, then can sleep somewhere in zone C just before border. There are no special places to sleep, but if you can sleep both sitting, then it is Ok. The good news that Wow air not so strict on baggage size. The limit is 42x32x25cm for free of charge baggage item, but during my flight back I used school bag with exactly these sizes (and with much inside it could be even 43x33x30cm), and this still was Ok.

I was aware of the extra charges many reviewers have commented on in their reviews. Therefore, when booking I could clearly see the true cost and was aware of additional fees. For two people (My wife and I) we paid €750 for a one way ticket from San Francisco to Dublin with a short stopover in Reykjavik. This included check in luggage up to 20Kg, carry on luggage (10 Kg) and a personal item (rucksack, handbag). This was more than sufficient and the extra fees paid for this luggage allocation are included in the €750. The flight from SFO- Reykjavík was on the Airbus A330 aircraft with a flight time of 8 hrs. Although the leg room was tight, it was by no means uncomfortable, once you took a regular stretch or walk as you should do on any airline. Limited food menu was available onboard. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The one negative was that the universal charge points beneath the seat were not working, however, the staff obliged by charging in their rest area. After a short stopover in Reykjavik we boarded a new Airbus A321 to Dublin and this plane had all the modern comforts of a brand new aircraft.

A321,WOW air,Economy Class,May 2018,18th May 2018,0,3,4,UnitedStates,8.0,yes,"I got scared reading negative reviews and want to offer a different experience. We flew on a XXL (BIZ-Class) ticket from Baltimore to Frankfurt and back and had a very pleasant experience. WoW Air operates one of the newest aircraft fleets and all four planes we flew with were 2016 or 2017 build. Our ticket included priority boarding, seat selection, free luggage, free meal and drink. Nothing to complain about. Staff on the plane was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Now, here seems to be the trick: We did a little research and talked to folks who had flown WoW Air before and got some insights. Make sure you adhere to their luggage requirements. Understand that an XXL seat is a seat of the exact same size as any other seat, but it's in the exit row and gives you the additional leg room. There was mention, however in the magazine that the airline has started to add ""real"" Business Class seats to their Airbus 300 planes and plans the same upgrades, with confirmed seating option, to their 321/320 fleet. Know that you do not have in-board entertainment unless you bring your own I-Pad or pay 25$ to rent one. Understand that everything, from water to food, will cost you money. So the bottomline: If you pay only $126 on-way to Frankfurt and expect a 5-star service, you'd be thoroughly disappointed and write a review like the ones we read. If you pay about $400, you get the premium treatment and write a review like this. One thing I can't comment on, is how their service develops once something goes wrong, like many reviewers experienced.

Incapable, uncaring, rude, unprofessional and overall, exhaustingly disappointing.

First reason I was given by the ground staff ""Aircraft has been switched, the seat you were assigned does not exist on this plane."" I called WOW, on hold for 30 minutes, to be told that the exact same thing by the agent over the phone. They were offering to book me on the next WOW flight, which was two (2!) days later. I refused. Told I had to wait 60 minutes and follow up then. Spoke with another agent 60 minutes later (after being on hold for another 30 minutes), to be told I was denied because the flight was overbooked. Put on hold multiple times, for the call to be ""dropped"" and for me having to call again. The third phone agent I reached asked me for the same information, and then proceeded to tell me that the reason was because I had misspelled my middle name on the boarding ticket. I do not have a middle name. They were grasping at straws trying to find an excuse. I emailed my passport information to them as well as the boarding pass so that the agent could review it. After 1.5 hours I was finally told I was denied because it was overbooked. No fault of my own, next flight was in 2 days, I could be booked on that. I refused and wanted a refund, as well as WOW covering my hotel charge due in Brussels. ""We are not able to refund you sir"". Overall, absolutely horrible experience.

A320 & A330,WOW air,Economy Class,March 2018,18th March 2018,1,1,2,UnitedArabEmirates,2.0,no,"I was sitting in row 3 on both flights, Brussels to Reykjavik and Reykjavik to Miami. For the first time I have experienced flight crews that limit the use to passengers of the forward toilet. An absolute never-again moment for me. There was a gaggle of cabin attendants continuously in the front galley of this A330-200. They did their normal thing in the cabin and spent a lot of time eating and drinking and chatting behind closed curtains. Before take-off the lavatory lock was set to closed (normal procedure, lifting the tab and closing the lock) but I noticed that the red light in the cabin remained red for a long time, well into the cruise phase of the flight. I assumed that unlocking the lavatory was somehow forgotten so I got up to ask and go to the toilet. I was told by a cabin attendant that the lavatory was “inoperable”. Which is not a word a cabin attendant will voluntarily use. “Unserviceable” maybe, or “broken”. I got back to my seat and started paying attention to this. With no inflight entertainment I had plenty time to do this. And what happened? From time to time the lavatory occupied light in the cabin went from red to green, then back to red, and so on. The lavatory was being used. At the same time, every passenger who came forward to use the lavatory was told to go to the back. Each and every one. I’m actually really upset by this. The cabin attendant who told me that the lavatory was “inoperable” lied to my face. If for some reason WOW has a policy of limiting the use of the front lavatory for (flight) crew only, then so be it. But then be open about it and do not lie to me. After the flight I had the urge to wait for the captain to appear from his cockpit to congratulate him on having such a strong bladder because during the almost 8 hours that they have been in their seats, not once did I see either one of the flight crew making a trip to the back of the aircraft to make a lavatory visit. There was no need of course. They had their own “inoperable” lavatory. Else: Poor in-flight food / I find the meal choice a very slim one for a 7.5 hour flight. Also weird that on my first flight I was given 2 meals for both flights (“this is how we do things” said the cabin attendant on my first flight). Then on my second flight I was given another meal. Now I had three. Cabin on board not clean/comfortable / The cushion of my big seat was flat and loose. The big seats don’t have enough pitch, and I could not use my laptop when the passenger in front had his seat back in my lap. Poor service on board / My biggest gripe on these flights. While the WOW PA is not bad, certainly better than most I've listened to and funny at times even, the cabin crew really is not interested in the passengers, other than milking money. They spend as much time as is possible behind their closed curtains (front) unless a passenger needs something (which means buying something) and then it’s all smiles and “how can we help?”. Poor in-flight entertainment / So I found out that one either brings their own device or can rent an iPad.

Then, I read all the mostly-negatives reviews. I decided that I knew what I was in for (no entertainment, no free meals or drinks, etc.) and decided the reviewers were probably just hard-to-please. I paid for the checked bag and carry-on. Turns out, we didn't need carry-ons, so that was a waste of money. Also paid for ""priority boarding"". Found out that meant you get to board a bus first that takes you half way across the airport to get on the plane. Not so bad in L.A., but when landing in Iceland at 4.00 am, in cold and blowing snow, one really doesn't want to wait at the top of a flight of stairs while a second bus is brought up to carry passengers to the terminal. And, it's annoying to see empty gates at which the ""real airlines"" get to park. Obviously, one of the ways WOW saves money is by not paying to use those jetways. The bus trips are a true annoyance. Flights not so bad (paid for a ""comfy"" seat in front, a must!) as long as you bring a sandwich and water. Flight crews not especially helpful or friendly. Found out that it's much cheaper to buy the food on board (which didn't look bad) rather than buy food in Iceland. $45 for 2 cheeseburgers in the terminal opposed to $11 for a meal on board.

I only flew them because I had left my booking 'till the last minute and the fare was $780 USD versus $1200 on BA. But in nearly every aspect of the journey it was fine. You prepare yourself for flying an LCC by dressing super casual, bring your reading and a loaded Ipad, plus a pillow and of course food. Cocoon yourself and the journey does go by. One key suggestion is to pay the extra $100 each way and get seat selection in their ""XXL"" cabin which has 35"" of pitch vs 32"" on the left side which is just ""XL"" and the back 2/3 of the plane which is a cramped 30"" or even worse. With the exception of one nasty gate agent in KEF - who shouted to get everyone upstairs to board while the bridge was jammed and people tripping over the stalled escalator, all staff interactions were fine. The crews on all 4 segments were either good or great. Yes you pay for water, so bring your own bottle and fill it at the airport! Yes you pay $12 for two beer. The A321 has much wider seats than the 787 or the 10 abreast 777 so that made things more comfortable. However, be careful when booking as it appears only 4 of their 321 fleet have such a large XXL or XL cabin in the front. I would dread to be on one of their super high density A321s at 220 seats (these 4 have only 200 seats). The connection in KEF was too long in both directions but plenty of super expensive cafes and power outlets. Plus the cleanest toilets I have ever seen in the world, this is a great plus for a transit. My only complaint, and this is major, is that the seats had cushions that were squashed flat. They were so thin that it felt like you were sitting on a sliding metal pan. For God's sake WOW, put new seat cushions in. If it wasn't for that, I would have rated the experience an 8. If the fare was within $200,sure I would have flown on someone like BA (for points, IFE and booze) but overall it wasn't that much of a torture.

The first time my flight was great. My second time was challenging to say the least coming home to LA. After Security I had to walk to the furthest corridor to reach my gate.

Once on board the cargo hooks were not working. Maintenance had to come and fix that issue prior to us taking off. The pilot said it can be anywhere from 5-30 minutes. The passenger were irate because WOW cancelled a slew of flights the previous day for some non existent storm. When we departed AMS it was well after 1pm. My connecting flight to LA was departing at 4:00 and my flight from AMS-KEF was 2 1/2 hours. We arrived in KEF at 3:15. We didn’t pull to the gate instead we departed the plane in the middle of the air field and took the shuttle to the terminal. Plus I still had to go through passport control. When I looked at the monitor upon entering the terminal the LA flight was on “final call”. I made the flight to LA, and landed safely.I pulled my bag from the baggage carousel and attempted to pull up my handle and it would come up. I looked at my bag closer and I noticed snow and mud marks on my bag. When I checked my bag in at AMS my bag was fine.

I told him I could hold and he said that wasn’t possible and hung up on me. I called again and he answered again I told him I have all day to wait. It was 5 am in LA (clearly I had all day). He hung up again and this time I was pissed. I called the ticket customer service and explained my situation. I asked the representative for WOW corporate address or phone she wouldn’t give it out. I then went to my public twitter that has about 500 followers and stated my disservice and surprise surprise someone responded. I called the baggage claim department again and the same person gave me a number for LAX baggage claim. I called the number and the number was out of service. I called again and he finally sent me a claim form. By this time it was about 7am. I filled out the form and sent it back. A few days later I received an email from WOW stating that my bag looks “fixable” and to take it in. If it’s not fixable then submit a letterhead from the luggage repair shop stating such.

Many of the passengers on the flight were either not wearing masks at all, or wearing them in such a way that it was neither covering their mouth nor their nose. I initially kindly asked some of the infringing passengers to properly wear the mask, to which they first ignored me and then they started making insulting comments towards me in Romanian (I speak the language so I understood what they said). When I raised this issue with members of the crew, they shrugged me off and told me that there is nothing they can do about it and that I should sort this issue. I do not believe that it is the job of passengers to enforce basic covid safety rules, and I also believe that the airline has a duty of care towards all its passengers. The incident made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe during the entire duration of the flight. Moreover, I noticed that during the entire duration of the flight, no member of the flight crew took any measure or said anything towards other rule infringing passengers, not even when passengers without masks were passing by them on the corridor. I find this to be unacceptable, for a member of the flight crew to pass multiple infringing passengers on the corridor and not do even as much as ask them to follow international guidelines and regulations regarding safety during the Covid Pandemic.

No, it is not just for your preferred seats, but irrespective of which seats you select and occasionally you can't even do that. Note that the Wizz Air online check-in closes 3 hours before departure! 2) To not pay for the check-in, according to the Wizz Air website, is possible at the airport by using the self-service check-in, and if those are not available at the traditional check-in desk. 3) However, this is not the case. At Milan Malpensa Terminal 1 on Friday, and at Vienna Terminal 3 on Sunday (today), there was no self-service check-in available (I confirmed this with the available check-in staff), and the traditional check-in counter would only check us in if we paid €15/person. 4) This is not all, at MXP the payment is handled by another desk which charges a €5/person commission and at VIE the commission is €5/transaction. So when you book with Wizz Air you need on paying at least €7-8 for the check-in online, or €15 if you do so at the airport plus €5 commission. This is not an optional extra service!

I paid for 10KG luggage I didn’t actually need. I thought I was signing up for priority but to be honest I did the booking quickly and didn’t read everything. Trick is to read very carefully regarding the numerous add on options. I only had a really small bag so didn’t need that add on at all. What I should have done was chose my seating at the time of booking. I waited till after and it ended up costing me more. No doubt about it, their software will stick you in a middle seat, probably far away form anyone else in the booking. Trick is to select your seat at the time of Booking.

Flights for all sectors were on time. Boarding was efficient and good to see that Wizz Air staff ensure that priority passengers are actually given priority in boarding. Cabin crew were business-like and pleasant. Announcements from the flight deck were audible and informative. Wizz Air sent useful SMS the day prior to the flight home advising of possible air-traffic delays (which did not materialise). Most of the low marks awarded to Wizz Air on Skytrax appear to be attributable to the fact that customers do not (or can not) read the terms and conditions (T&C) attaching to the tickets.

The flight procedure at the airport is very easy as everything is self-service and robotic.

Beside the cleanliness of the plane which is definitely becoming an issue, I´m thinking about the health of the crew which is supposed to take care of me and the whole plane. The seats are very narrow and tight, extremely hard and me being tall 190cm luckily, I had to sit just for 1h 30 minutes in the plane, because it gets very narrow and uncomfortable.

My WIZZ Flex ticket allowed me to choose an emergency exit row seat (26F) with ample legroom. This seat however does not have a window and I bumped into the person next to me several times due to the insufficient seat width. The cabin crew were very friendly and welcoming throughout the flight. There was a good selection of food and beverages available onboard and they were reasonably priced. When I arrived at the gate for this flight we were informed that the flight was delayed but unfortunately no passenger announcement was made to explain why. When I asked the employee at the gate they told me that the expected delay would be an hour. An hour later, we were told that our flight would depart from a different gate and we made our way to the alternate gate. We then waited another hour with no announcements made before the boarding process commenced and we were able to get on the buses. It was only once we had boarded our aircraft that we were told that the delay had been caused by a maintenance issue and that the pilot's windscreen had now been repaired. I understand that safety is paramount but I was still frustrated by the lack of information on the ground. If we were given a more accurate delay time and and actual reason for the delay back at the gate I would have been content. We finally departed 2.5 hours after our estimated time of departure. Also, the boarding process was hectic and the ground staff should have been more clear regarding priority boarding. The announcements that they did make were unintelligible and could not be heard.

Despite all the bad reviews, I had a wonderful experience with them. I had the Light “plan” selected with Wizz Priority added. I had no issues or whatsoever regarding my cabin luggage (did not have any checked-in baggage), the process at the gate went smoothly and very quickly (might be worth mentioning that on both outbound and return flights, the gate opened with a delay but regardless, everything went pretty fast afterwards). You only get priority when boarding the bus and at the gate, when they do the check-in, not when boarding the aeroplane like one may think. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful, the outbound flight was extremely smooth, no turbulences at all, the returning one had a few moments where it was slightly shaky. Yet, it was all good. The online check-in process was very easy. Be aware that if you do not check-in online, you pay a fee for the airport check-in. As for the luggage again, they even let this woman with a bag that clearly exceeded their dimensions limit in the cabin. Maybe she got lucky. Overall, I would fly Wizz again and I will in December, the same route. Absolutely love it. No “hidden” or “extra” fees as long as you read their rules carefully.

Every flight I have taken has been delayed to some extent: the shortest delay I can recall was of 20 minutes the longest was of about 2.5 hours. My flight on 2nd July was delayed by 1.5 hours. Wizz Air has used a variety of excuses when apologising in the aircraft for the delay in taking-off and arrival so it's not even worth repeating them. There is no point passengers and potential passengers trying to identify the reasons why this company seems incapable of taking-off and landing at the correct time, particularly on certain routes and particularly from Luton. The cabin crew on all my flights have been polite and professional but they too have seemed jaded and worn-down by the lack of on-time performance after all, a flight that lands at 2.30am (instead of at the scheduled midnight) means a very late arrival home for the crew as well. The standard crew comment that ""this is aviation and you have to expect such things"" is now becoming the company's mantra. I don't care that Wizz Air charges for all types of luggage after the first small personal item I don't care that I have to pay for seat selection as well as for food and drink nor do I care much about the cleanliness of the exterior and interior of the aircraft.

We bought priority boarding to been able to have an extra small suitcase with us. One week before they sent a mail (out of many), that we now can check in. I tried to check in, but then discovered that we needed to buy a seat, or wait until 48 hours before the flight. We waited, and when we checked in, we could not choose seats. The three of us were placed in seat a and c in one row and the last person somewhere else. When we boarded the plane, of course they have placed a person in the b seat. The same happened on the return flight, even if the plane was far from full. I do not like their way of getting more money out of every ticket. The flight is short 1.5 hours, so it is no problem to sit in a narrow seat with your knees in the seat in front of you. We left in the evening on a cold day in Norway, the plane was full, and every passenger had jacket and pullovers.

A320,Wizz Air,Economy Class,October 2018,1st November 2018,1,1,4,UnitedKingdom,2.0,no,"Today, I had THE worst experience of my life on Wizz Air. I arrived early for boarding so that I could find room for my backpack in the overhead compartment - which I did. I then took my row 'C' aisle seat. After boarding was completed, I was made to remove my backpack by the stewardess and force it under the seat in front of me. My backpack is large, flexible and within Wizz Air's size limits, but placing it there meant that there was no room left for my feet. (See photos). I could not place my feet outside in the corridor area, either as it would have tripped other passengers who were walking and blocked the food trolleys. I had no choice but to place my feet under the metal braces in the seat in front, meaning that every time the passenger in front moved in his seat, my foot would get crushed. By the end of the flight my foot was bruised, and I was in pain, simply because my bag was too large to fit under the seat, and it should have been left in the over head compartment. Upon pointing this to the stewardess who instigated this episode without any consideration of the consequences, she told me to write to Wizz Air and complain, and that there was nothing she could do. It may be that Wizz Air will read this and decide to reply, stating that shortly larger bags, such as the one which I had to remove mine for will not be allowed without an extra fee. However, that is not the point. At the time of my journey, this was allowed, and. Wizz Air provided zero safe foot space. My bag was also too large to fit under the seat in front, and should have stayed in the overhead locker. Additionally, as my bag was too large to fit the seat in front, it was blocking the emergency escape route of the passengers sitting in the window and middle rows. This is dangerous, and I believe against passenger air transport safety rules. There were also a couple of other, issues regarding hygiene. I noticed that the toilets were cleaned by cabin crew, without wearing gloves, using paper towels from inside of the toilets. First the seat was wiped, then the sink and finally the same towel was dropped on the floor and the floor was wiped using the shoes. The stewardess then pick up the papers from the floor using her hands and flushed them down the toilet. After this, and without washing her hand, she walked to the food trolley and started serving food to passengers, touching coffee cups, water bottles, serviettes and sandwich wrappers. This has to be the worst case of hygiene which I have ever come across, and I would not trust any food served on this airline. I also noticed that the headrests on the seats had grease marks on them, as the paper headrests were missing. The Velcro exists to hang the headrests from, but in order to save costs, it seems like Wizz Air have decided not to care about this item either. I have travelled on Wizz Air on numerous occasions in the last 10 years or so (about 10 times this year alone), however the service has reduced dramatically, the prices have any rocketed (they are often more expensive than national carrier National carriers) and the staff's attitude to customers is simply atrocious - possibly due to their fast expansion. Because of a staff members attitude, the poor and dirty hygiene, over crowding, and bad value for money, I will not travel on Wizz any more, and I recommend that you check the prices of other airlines before booking with Wizz Air.",Warsaw to London,2,1,wizz-air,bad value for money,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,2,1,750df282-f9fe-4e78-ab1c-3a047c041b91

Also checked in on line to ensure a trouble free departure and booked our cab to arrive early so we could get through and enjoy a coffee while we waited for departure.  So you would thing I did everything right? How wrong was I! On arrival at the Wizz Air check in, the queue was several hundred passengers deep, I pointed out to an official that all we needed to do was check in 1 bag ""join the queue"" was the terse reply. 55 minutes later, we finally arrived at the check in to be told that our on line check in did not apply, and we had to go the whole procedure again. Wizz Air did not have have enough staff at the check in counters. While 12 desks were ""open"" only 6 were manned....absolutely pathetic service. The end result was a rush to the departure gate, only to find that everyone was ""herded"" into a departure lounge that had seating for less than 10% of passengers. Priority boarding passengers were lined up outside the terminal and had to wait in the hot sun (it was an unusually warm English day) while the delayed incoming aircraft was refueled, resulting in several having to force their way back through the queue to get some shade.

The first absolute scam from this airline. The second leg was an even more dreadful experience.

Unfortunately for them now they had to offer online checking instead, but they make you regret of it as you have to work feeling endless camps (only left asking where our mothers work for each passenger). I avoided that but then comes the flight. Flight got delayed as when boarding people was unboarded without info and rude manners on some ground personnel. In the end over 2 hours delay due to technical problems (but it could be whatever) When boarding with our baby (9 months) although we carry a Yoyo/Baby Grace babycar and its specifically for flying on cabin (that's why we bought it and even in other lowcost never posed problems) after a long discussion they made us to put it down as usual luggage.  The senior cabin crew didn't have any idea of her job about this. Sits can not be bended even 1cm. But I will be fair and say I had other low cost with less space for legs (which doesnt mean here you had more than just enough to survive being 185cm.

While on holiday I got an automated text from Wizz Air saying my flight had been changed and I would have got an email with my new flight details. There was no email, and my account showed I was still on the same flight. Looking on Facebook, a lot of people had this issue and Wizz Air admitted (on Facebook, where not many people would check) that the text was sent in error. This is after lots of people (according to their comments on Facebook) spent lots of money calling their premium number to check what happened to their flight (many waiting upwards of half an hour and many not even getting through!). I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane. We waited, standing, on the bus for over half an hour before it took us to the plane. What's worse (not for me, but for the Priority passengers) is the other buses left before us so ours actually got to the plane second last! Priority were the first to the bus and amongst the last on the plane. Aside from being fast-tracked through security at Budapest (which had no queue anyway), I saw no evidence of Priority adding anything. Once on the plane, staff were nice and obliging, and the plane was clean. Food is expensive but you can bring your own from the airport. Tea is 2.5 Euros but you can ask for extra hot water for free. The pilot gave detailed information on the route and weather. The boarding process is very painful and I don't remember a single Wizz Air flight being on time (and I have flown with them several times).

So, generally I think Wizz is good value, on time, clean comfortable cabins (if you have long legs buy your seats in rows 1, 12 or 13. If you join the Discount scheme you get good value for money and the premium package for frequent flyers is well worth it as seat selection etc is free when you pay the annual fee.  Priority boarding I have only had one negative experience and this was at Sofia airport on an internal flight, poorly organised but this is not usual for Wizz. The cabin crew are usually friendly although sometimes they are tired on late flights. On board service is good. Announcements from the flight deck are sometimes inaudible or heavily accented and of no use.

Priority boarding is worth the extra money as it allows you to cut the queue's and also guarantees your on board extra bag. I had an on board meal of baguette and tea which was reasonably priced and very nice. I flew on an Airbus A321 which was only 10 months old so very modern and clean. Highly recommended airline.

Since the plane was not full, I asked if it is possible to relocate my seat, because I would like to sit next to my spouse.

When things go ok, they go ok. There is nothing more to it. When things need attention or handling, the Wizz system shows the worst of an airliner with rules so strict it is impossible to accept its own mistakes. 2 days before return trip we wanted to buy extra luggage. The Wizz webpages malfunctioned on first attempt, failing just before I expected a receipt for the luggage purchase. Ok, I thought, I'll try tomorrow, I'm sure its working again by then. Tried again the next day. Tried from two different computers, and one cell phone. Same malfunction. Thought that now they know about it, and its time to get to the airport. When the error has been there for days, it should be possible to handle it at the airport. Of course not, they dont acknowledge the error or their responsibility for having working webpage functions, when their whole service is surrounded on customers handling ordering etc. Customer service wont pay me back the airport fee of course, and only repeats its my own responsibility.

Boarding in Vilnius was quite messy, all passengers have been checked at gate and after this they had to wait on stairs for quite a long time, even those who had bought Priority pass - so actually there's no reason to buy it. The plane was located quite far from terminal building but we weren't taken there by bus, we had to go on foot. The aircraft is very cramped, the flight was fully booked and there wasn't enough place for hand luggage onboard so many passengers had to put it under the front seat which is not comfortable at all. However, all aforementioned is quite acceptable for a low-cost carrier. But after take-off it became extremely hot and it was very difficult to breathe, almost all passengers continued coughing during the whole flight - I suppose there were some issues with air conditioning?
