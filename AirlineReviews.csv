,United Airlines,Economy Class,October 2017,27th October 2017,1,1,3,UnitedStates,2.0,no,"Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Chicago. United used to be a good airline company. In the past, if you’d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, and you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, that’s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family. Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). I’m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, it’s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage I’ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply can’t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt they were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldn’t wait to get out of the plane.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,August 2017,16th October 2017,0,1,1,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"My last trip on United Airlines left me feeling angry, tricked, humiliated and disrespected. The new Basic Economy fair offered by United appears to be a marketing trick to make their lowest fair seem competitive with other airlines' basic fares. They are not when you consider the grab for further dollars one experiences at the airport kiosk by attendants stationed there for no other reason than to hold one's boarding pass hostage until they can very strictly put one through a bag measurement process almost certainly designed to fail most bags. When I made my airline selection for this trip, I had three acceptable airline choices for what seemed to be comparable economy fares, with similar measurement maximums for one's allowable personal item. I selected United for no other reason than their fare and bag seemed to match the others, but I liked the flight time slightly better. I could have just as easily chosen either of the other two airlines. Had I known the ugliness and embarrassment that they cause me in front of my daughter due to their extortion of further funds at the kiosk, I would certainly have chosen one of the other two. United seems to continually hate and disrespect their customers with policies and procedures designed to humiliate them for needing to fly on a budget due either to family or other commitments. When I left home, I carefully measured both my and my 11 year old daughter's personal items. Aside from the wheels on her very small child's size suitcase, both items fit the measurements. I put my purse inside my personal item, such that between the two of us we had exactly two items. The Basic Economy fare does not allow one to check in online before getting to the airport. One is forced to print one's boarding pass at the airport kiosk. When one arrives at the kiosk, one cannot complete the boarding pass process with having an attendant approve final printing of the pass by checking the size of the personal item, then scanning his/her badge to unlock the system. The attendant had no problem with our personal items when we left our home airport. We arrived at our destination without incident. United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home. Returning home from Dallas international airport a few days later was a completely different story. I had to get up in the middle of the night to return our rental car and make a 6am flight. When we arrived at the kiosk, the attendant put us through a rigorous bag measuring process. A zipper on my personal item kept catching on the metal, but I was able to get the bag into the box. I was very tired from having gotten up in the middle of the night, and forgot to put my purse into my personal item. I had to struggle to stuff it in at the last minute. My daughter's very small suitcase fit exactly, except for the small wheels. The suitcase fit with plenty of room to spare on the way to Dallas. The kiosk attendant stated that the measurement requirements had nothing to do with whether or not the item fit under the seat, meaning they were in place solely as a justification to get more money. Once I paid for the bag, the attendant didn't even finish printing our boarding passes. I had to get another attendant to finish printing them. The attendants are there for no other purpose than to collect more money by scrupulously measuring bags. They are not there for any benefit to the customer whatsoever.

This was fine, I would not be able to carryon or handle checked luggage anyway because of recent shoulder surgery. I shipped my things via UPS to my destination. I had no problems from CVG to ORD other than the plane being delayed an hour – no big deal. The problem was when I got to ORD for the return trip. When I got to the airport they would not give me a boarding pass to get through security because I had a small purse and a 13"" laptop case. They interpreted the rule as only 1 carryon which was my purse. I brought both of them from CVG to ORD with no problem but in ORD I could not take the laptop. My purse was considered my 1 bag. I talked to 2 people and they both refused me. I tried to get them to let me take it to the gate for their checking but was refused that also. I could not check the laptop in the hold because it was a flimsy case that would not take the beating of the conveyor belt and it had a lithium battery. I had to leave my laptop with a friend to express ship to me at a great cost. I found this whole incident outrageous and unacceptable.

They provide electrical sockets under the seat. However, due to short leg room, it is very hard to plug anything in, and to even keep it without knocking it out. Food is a disaster.

We arrived in Newark with no mishaps and when we went to a United counter to see what gate our connecting flight was leaving from, we were told that flight had been cancelled, but no reason was given. Instead, we were directed to a customer service counter with a very long line and only two agents assisting customers. Come to find out, United cancelled several flights from Newark that day. After standing in line for almost two hours (while also trying to talk to a person on the United hotline number while in line and receiving no help), it was finally my turn to speak to a desk agent. The agent was no help at all, and told me the flight had been cancelled due to weather, and since it was a weather issue, he told me United was not responsible to help with lodging, rental cars, etc. The soonest we could be booked on another flight was the following Monday, July 3. His solution was my family of four was welcome to remain in the airport throughout the weekend. That being an unacceptable option we, and apparently every other United customer affected by cancellations, went to rent a car and finally found a car available to drive to Norfolk. After cancelling our flight, the best they can offer is for us to stay in the airport for two nights and three days?

I called back to explain this again and she said for us to sit together I would have to pay to be upgraded. Meanwhile the flight out of FWA was delayed even further due to a part not coming in, and so I had to find an alternate route. She couldn't find me anything out of FWA that day, so we ended up having to drive to Chicago. Only then, when I told her we were driving did she upgrade our seats for us to sit together. On the way back, we cancelled the flight back from Chicago or Fort Wayne as our car was parked in Chicago. The desk in Anchorage said our last leg to FWA was never cancelled so our luggage was going to be sent there, I asked her to cancel our last leg and the lady at the desk told me I had to call to cancel it myself, and that they couldn't print off a baggage tag to have our luggage end up in Chicago. After being on the phone for 20 mins and the lady on the phone not understanding anything (as they never did every time I called, which was 5+ times) they were calling all United flights to Chicago to check in.

I asked if they could push the drink cart back for me to get through and I would wait to go to my seat until they were finished.

Using her buddy passes this means that I fly standby (which means I only get a seat if one is available). I decided to fly home for the weekend so I decided to fly from Detroit airport to Newark on June 23rd. There were about 15-20 open seats on this flight so I knew there should be no problem getting on the flight. There were a few delays due to air traffic control and that is normal and expected on a busy day like Friday. After waiting a few hours in delays, it was finally time for my flight to board. I stood right by the podium as I waited for everyone to board and once they finished I went right up the front desk to ask if any stand bys have been called yet. The lady said she wasn't sure and that she had to wait for one of the other agents to come back because she would have the answer. I waited about 5-10 minutes for the other agent to go back and I nervously kept looking at the screen to make sure that I didn't miss my name being called but the screen still said ""Boarding"" and my name was not checked off the screen yet despite all of the empty seats. The United agent finally returned and when I asked her about the stand by's she had nothing to say to me. All she said was that the doors were already closed and that I would not be making it on the flight. I did not understand what she was saying because there were no announcements made AT ALL about final boarding. Not only did the agent forget to call the whole stand by list, she never announced that boarding was coming to an end. Before the flight even began boarding, I specifically went up to the Agents and told them I was flying stand by and I asked them if they would be calling out my name so that I could receive my ticket. They assured me they would call me once everyone else was boarded. However, this was not the case at all. While this whole ordeal was happening, I was talking to my mom on the phone who told me that she never has seen something like this in her 28 years of flying. She was very upset by this as was I and instructed me to see if there was something else I could talk to. When I asked the lady if I could talk to someone else about this problem, she told me there was nobody else I could talk to about this issue. The lady then began to ignore me when I continued to talk to her about this problem. I was absolutely baffled on how an airline could just get away without giving a final boarding call for a flight. There was also another person on stand by who missed out on this flight because the agents never made the proper announcements. This was the last flight out for the day so it caused me to be stuck in Detroit for the night when this never should have happened considering there were over 15 seats open. Not only did the lady refuse to help or even tell me what happened, she failed to do one of her basic duties as an agent - which is make the proper announcements.

There was one who was very sarcastic and rude to a passenger and another who was not knowledgeable of the food she was serving. The food portions were rather small compared to a domestic trans-con flight. For dinner, they served chicken rice or pasta with a roll and a cup of salad, and vanilla ice cream.  In the middle of the flight, they served snacks. Ice-cold ham & cheese sandwich with Asian-style trail mix and a chocolate. The sandwich was terrible. I gave praise to the crew walking around the cabin giving away water in between meal times. Then before landing, breakfast. Cheese omelet with a ""rubber"" sausage and hashbrowns or this Japanese chicken rice with this bourbon cookie.

My colleague and I were traveling for business this morning and had to be in Omaha by 10:30 AM.

What I am upset about is their solution to this series of unfortunate events. We were immediately shut down at the airport by the United concierge lady and she said that these reservations were non-refundable and there was nothing she could do. She suggested that we call the 1-800 number and they may be able to help us further. Once I got back into the office I called the United Airlines 1-800 number. Once I was connected to a live representative she said that she would be able to credit those trips back to both of us for future use with United ($128.80 each), but we would have to pay a ""flight change"" fee of $200 EACH. She basically told me that we would each have to give United Airlines $200 before we could use the $128.80 credit that each of us have.  What I am taking away from this is that United Airlines does not care about it customers and the situations that they are put in. We had no intentions of cancelling these trips and only did so because we had no choice given the circumstances. They offered no help whatsoever and did not provide any sort of solution to the unfortunate situation that we were both in.

First of all, I always fly American Airlines, but this time I decided to try out the cheaper option. This was a huge mistake. I signed up for flight updates twice, once when I bought the ticket, and once when I checked in for the flight ahead of time. I get to the airport and it turns out that they booked me on a train to Newark without making that clear. Luckily, I was early like I always am for my flights so I lugged my two suitcases to the train station to catch the train to Newark. After all this, I get to the counter in Newark and they tell me my flight was canceled. Mind you, I made sure my phone was on and charged all day to make sure I would be notified of any changes to the flight. The United employee told me the next flight out was for 7am the next day, but that they would not cover the cost of a hotel for the night, despite it being their error that put me in this position. I then ask if I can have them cover the cost for a train back to Philly, and they print the ticket out right there and hand it to me, and then they tell me if I want to get to Jacksonville (my original destination) that I would have to pay for a whole new ticket. When I make it clear that it's unacceptable for me to be forced to buy two full-priced tickets to the same destination, they tell me the ticket they handed me back to Philly was non-refundable. Then I ask if I can at least get on the 7am flight they mentioned before, but now they're telling me that it's completely booked, as well as the flight after that. The next flight I could be guaranteed a seat on is over a day from then, and again, they will not help with hotel costs. By now, I'm livid, and I talk to a supervisor and they take the ticket back, telling me they wouldn't be able to give me a refund on my ticket at all, despite it being their error that put got me stranded in Newark. After calling customer service I finally talk to someone who will give me a refund, but now I'm forced to buy a ticket for over a hundred more because it's last second, when I originally bought my ticket over a week ahead of time. They should have at least offered me the soonest flight from a competing airline, but they gave me nothing except a guarantee that I'll be paying hundreds more out of pocket for an absolutely terrible experience. I have been on several flights, both domestic and international, but United has by far been the worst experience I've had ever.

I went on the United's website where I saw carry on bags were allowed on the plane.

At that point I asked a floor customer service representative about the notification I received regarding the full size carry on.

To make matters worse when I arrived at the gate and they began to call passengers by group number, the representative clearly stated in her announcement passengers boarding with group numbers 1-4 may bring on a carry on luggage. I of course was in group 5, therefore I was disqualified. Although I saved money purchasing a ticket via priceline.com, in the end United made that money back by forcing me pay for my carry on bag.

Wouldn't it be easier to keep customers happy whenever possible? Beyond customer service, this is bad business practices. The airline business is time critical once a flight leaves, an airline can't make any more money from that flight for ticket sales.

The seats are comfortable, the screen is a nice size and the new amenities kit is excellent. The seats are lie flat and offer a great rest. However, they are somewhat difficult to adjust at the intermediate levels, the upright and lie flat are done at the push of a button. Other than that, the only complaint I had was for the lack of storage on the seat - the old seats (and this may have been the ones in first) and small nooks to store stuff. That is not the case here, or at least I did not find them - so the storage has to be done in the overhead bins. Besides the very comfortable oversized pillow, United also provides you with two blankets, a regular one, and a slightly heavier quilted one. I initially used the quilted one, but since the temperature in the cabin was quite comfortable I eventually gave up on both. The food is a little lacking, for the first course, I chose the Halibut which was very good but second meal was a very dry and flavorless piece of chicken breast. This, in my opinion, is a problem, primarily because it is served an hour before landing and sticks in people's memories as their meal experience. The service while professional is not on par with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. While I cannot put my finger on it simply lacks the elegance and savoir-faire of their counterparts. Another big issue is the entertainment, while there is an excellent selection I cannot for the life of me understand why I constantly have to be subjected to Barracuda and Marriott advertising - it is not just once, but after every single show that I want to watch.

I called to see what happened only to be told, ""we have located your bag and we will put it on the first available flight out and have it delivered to you asap."" I was, confused and irritated. I explained that my bag was located the night before and should of already been delivered to me. They then told me I could go ahead and spend $150 to replace the items in my bag while they got this sorted out. I thought, well at least they are trying to do right by me. This game went on for 4 days! My bag was finally delivered after I returned home from my vacation and after several angry phone calls. They kept getting my delivery address wrong, my bag color wrong and managed to ship my bag to several different airports before it finally made its way home. Once my bag arrived, I called United to get the $150 refund that they promised me plus some compensation given all the hassle. They actually told me, ""sorry, looks like whoever told you that failed to make a note in the system so we cannot offer you a refund now.""

We all decided to wait where we were since we did not know how long the line was in B terminal. Then all of the sudden he says that this counter in F terminal was closed. He never pulled the strap and closed the line. We all said to him that he had told us they were going to one agent and we were all willing to wait.

It’s not like we were the first flight. There was a United flight leaving at the gate over 30 minutes before us. My fiancé and I ended up running to our next gate because what was a 40-minute layover turned into a 15-minute layover in a different terminal. After sprinting up and down to the gate at Chicago, we arrived in the knick-of-time. We were able to grab salads at a stand outside the gate. After boarding the plane, we decided to eat our salads. Oddly we are able to finish our entire salad without moving. After sitting for 30 minutes, the pilot informed us there is an abnormal number of children on the plane therefore we were waiting for children life jackets. An hour goes by and we are informed from the pilot’s calculations we will need additional fuel, so we waited on the fuel truck. At this point all the young children who needed life jackets, are highly uncomfortable because the plane is becoming warm - over 80 degrees. It was an older plane so they could not turn on the AC. Think about all the poor parents! Scheduling is important to everyone’s well-being and we are now an hour and half late. If you can believe it, we were then informed the fuel truck put too much fuel in the plane! We are now waiting for another truck to take out some of the fuel.

This is the first time I flew in a 767. I was most interested in the new United Polaris Business class. It may be different on the larger planes, however, on this aircraft the cabin was no different and was not new. The food from the new ""chef"" was the worst I've ever had in business class on any airline out of the 4 or 5 airlines I've traveled on in Business class. Having read the glorious PR about their new ""chef,"" I was really looking forward to the food. I wouldn't serve it in Economy and they ran out of the Chicken dish by the time they got to me. The fish (my reluctant second choice) was over cooked and dry. The green noodles were stuck together on the bottom where I assume they were overheated. On the flight from Palm Springs to Chicago, I was trapped in Economy since there was no business class on that plane. I sat in the 3rd row and the attendant announced they were out of the cheese plate and cheese burger to the row in front of me. I flew two days after the huge PR disaster, dragging a customer off the plane kicking and screaming. It seems that is not the only problem. This airline is not run well. When the poor attendant in Business class announced to me they were out of the chicken dish I ordered, I was a bit upset and she apologized and said it had been a rough couple of days. My other complaint is an ongoing problem that everyone I know is dealing with. They keep advertising their frequent flyer program but when you actually try to get a business class seat, it is impossible most of the time. As an exercise recently, I tried to get a seat for the rest of the year--8 months!--and there were two flights in those 8 months that I could get a business class seat flying from Palm Springs to Cork, Ireland, and of course that only applies to the long flight, not the two short flights on either end which must be economy. I tried last August to book Business class seats both ways on this current trip and there were no seats available on the return flight--though online it shows 27 available seats in Business class.

It took almost 20 minutes for me to find the map, then while we were something like 15th in line for takeoff (because that's just how things happen at O'Hare), the screen told me that my ""free preview"" of DirecTV was up and I had to pay to continue using the TV for anything, including the map. Shortly after takeoff, I opened the movie on my iPad and saw that I had forgotten to rent the movie I wanted to watch (and I admit that this was on me).

Showing up at the Aspen terminal for a flight to LAX, there were low clouds/ground fog that prevented the incoming aircraft from landing. Certainly not United's fault. Thus, this plane - intended to carry us to LAX - was diverted to the nearby, out-of-the-weather airport in Grand Junction. Those passengers were then bused up to ASE. Our complaint is that our flight group wasn't offered a ""return"" trip on that bus down to where the plane was residing (and wound up spending the night on the tarmac) at Grand Junction Reg Airport. No, we were all told - in spite of the inclement weather with promise of more to come - to ""come back early tomorrow morning that plane will surely be able to get in here for you."" Doubting this, we nonetheless secured an (expensive) one night unplanned additional stay nearby, awoke at 3:30 am Sunday, and got a ride back down to the still socked-in airport. Our intended plane went ahead and left Grand Junction not to come get us (it couldn't), but to head off to parts unknown. The weather was such that no plane wasn't getting in and the bus, was long gone. The bus that could have easily transported our departing group down to the plane in its nearby diverted location the day before. Frustration with the United gate agents at ASE led us, and several others, to rent cars (no easy task with such a limited inventory available at a small airport), and drive one-way to Los Angeles. Thank you so much, Hertz! 14 hours and $500.00 later (between the +1 night and rental car), United was out of our hair. The United gate agents seemed quite genuinely to not care a wit about the departing passenger's situations and needs. United bused the newly arriving folks in from the ""detour airport"", allowing that bus to subsequently dead-head off to who knows where.

But the traveller was a 72-year-old, non-English speaker. Because of this delay, she missed her second flight from SFO to Shanghai.

The service was excellent and the food and wines were good, however, I did not get my first choice, fish. So much for ordering the white wine and ending up with beef. My main complaint was that the fasten seatbelt sign came on at least 12 times during the flight and it was a smooth flight. Several times one little bump would cause the fasten seatbelt sign to appear, which would trigger the recorded announcement, ""Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign.

The television monitors (many which were turned off) would all turn back on and with a bright white background with the message a special announcement is in progress.

Thankfully we are capable of running as there would be no way less able, families or elderly would have got there in time! The Sydney flight was waiting for us, we boarded. My husband was at the front of the plane and I was right at the back. I had been a signed a seat that was already taken 39E (written on my boarding pass) I approached the hostess to ask for some direction/ help, which to then I seemed to be a bother to her. I was then told that I was wrong and my seat is 40E. This seat was already taken as well! I was then finally given an empty seat.. Throughout the flight the hostesses were rude, very unprofessional and made you feel like you were a nuisance. The older hostess bumped into me with her trolley and huffed like it was the worst thing ever. They all talk and giggle in the back like it's a teenage house party, chew gum, their hair is a mess and their attitudes are disgusting.

Among my many United flights I have randomly picked this one as an example. The airline has gone through many rough patches over the last couple of years. Poor management has led to very poor performance by the company as a whole. Unmotivated front-line employees, unresponsive customer service agents, older dirty planes remain a hallmark of United. Recently, the company has revamped their lagging international business class but the nicer pillows and blankets are not enough to cover up the many other deficiencies. The flight discribed here was a case in point: tired flight attendants, delays, lost luggage, helpless customer service agents lying about measures taken. This flight had all of the catastrophes that I have come to expect from United Airlines. Many people and United employees were hoping that a new CEO could turn things around.

I unfortunately pulled a muscle in my stomach, I should have used it anyway but I didn't.  She still did not care. We then found the line. 100s of people were in it with two agents to help.

When I asked if he had any gluten free options, he said ""I can't tell you if it's gluten free but you can look in the menu and try to buy something."" He couldn't be bothered with telling me the other options he had in his cart. When I looked at the menu the only completely gluten free option offered was a small bag of popcorn that costs almost $6. I asked the other flight attendant if there were any snacks like bananas, ""kind"" trailmix bars, or baked potato chips in the front of the plane. Her response was ""I don't know but the snacks for up front are you know, for up front."" So instead of sacrificing one snack item from the front of the plane that probably costs less than a dollar in actuality, both attendants left me with no food for the duration of the flight.

Depended on whom you asked: the crew was over their service limit; Customs in SXM wasn't willing to stay later to accommodate passengers; or The airline hasn't told us why.

Upon returning to the airport in the morning, there were a couple hundred people in line and no United staff at the check-in counter.

I waited for over 3 hours to speak to someone - when I finally got to the desk the woman was completely unhelpful and rude. She offered some inconvenient flights that wouldn't have gotten me home until late the next day. While in line I used my phone to find more convenient flights that I showed the woman and she says ""oh well I guess that would work too"". So I waited 3 hours to get absolutely no help. Since I was going to have to spend the night in the freezing airport, I asked if I could have a pillow and blanket for the evening (and I know they have them because they give bagged pillows and blankets to people in first class) - she told me that they don't provide amenities to people with cancelled flights. I also asked if I could have a food voucher since I was going to be at the airport for an extra 14+ hours that I hadn't planned on and she said they don't provide food vouchers to people unless their flight had been delayed for four hours. No my flight was not delayed for four hours it was cancelled and I was at the airport an extra 14 hours! So I ended up paying an extra $35 dollars on horrible, overpriced airport food because of my cancellation. I spent the night shivering, trying to sleep at the airport until my morning flight.

On my flight, there was a extra Polaris trainer on board for the cabin attendants but still the service was not smooth or elegant. Polaris is suppose to understand that rest and sleep is primary to the business flyer but the meal service took at least 2.5 hours with them still beginning to serve the ice cream when the lights were already dimmed. There was such a long time between courses as if the attendents didn't know what to do. I was seated next to the galley and watched them being disorganized and clumsy as the curtain was not closed. The Thai Airways personal cabin attendant knew my name as she introduced herself and all the courses, refill of drinks arrived swiftly and effortlessly like magic from behind a curtain. The cabin was always a sea of calm and tranquil unlike United noisy clatter. The one thing that was superior on United's Polaris was the cuisine.

UA895 was 12 hours long, and was advertised as having inflight entertainment and wifi when I booked it. The aircraft was old, so it had no personal TVs on the back of the chairs, just the main one near bulkhead. Not a big deal, but about 45 minutes into the flight, we were told the WiFi wasn't working. They tried resetting it, then called tech support, but could not fix it. We were told that because it was considered a ""premium"" item, we wouldn't be compensated. I didn't expect compensation, but on a 12 hour flight, I expected some effort to be made to make everyone more comfortable. Instead, there were 4 children in our cabin and they took turns crying for the entire 12 hours. I understand kids cry, and I felt terrible for the parents, they looked fatigued. The kids would only stop crying when the parents walked the aisles with them or stood where they could see the TVs, which obviously wasn't sustainable for a multitude of reasons. I imagine the flight would've been much more enjoyable for the parents, children, and other passengers if the wi-fi had worked. Additionally, even the entertainment on the screen near bulkhead crashed mid flight and had to be re-set, so even that was flawed. My second flight, UA153, was scheduled to depart at 12:05pm. At first it was delayed by 20 minutes, ""due to delayed incoming aircraft."" I decided to look it up, and saw that the flight, UA424, Dulles to San Francisco, was originally scheduled from 08.50-12.06. Yes, the scheduled landing was for 1 minute after our flight was scheduled to depart. This is a terrible planning failure on behalf of United, who knowingly scheduled a flight they knew wasn't going to depart at the scheduled time. Our flight didn't end up departing until close to 2pm, after loading up around 1.15, and then taxiing for a long time. Multiple people on our flight had connecting flights, which were missed or they narrowly made it to, especially since United didn't accommodate or prioritize their exit from the aircraft. This is extremely frustrating, especially knowing that United knowingly did this. There were over 100 people on the aircraft, all delayed an extra 1.5-2 hours, plus the people who missed their connecting flights and were even further delayed. United wasted 200+ hours of people's time that day. It seems extremely fraudulent that they knowingly did this. Last, I'm taking time to write this review this time, as every time I have flown United, I have experienced a delay of at least 1 hour. It is extremely disappointing as a customer. For example, on our flight from ORD to HKG, we were delayed by almost 5 hours. On a flight I took from DFW to XNA once, I was delayed by 4 hours.

As an American citizen traveling domestically, over the past 15 years, I've come to set the bar about as low as it can get for flying. That said, I will never fly United Airlines again. Enough is enough. My boyfriend and I had pre-selected our seats, yet did not have seat assignments after checking in. It's the holidays, so lines were long at check in. There was a woman in line with several suitcases, two of which were less than 4lbs over the weight limit. Instead of just taking pity on her and expediting the line by accepting her suitcases on the first, second, third and fourth times she repacked them, employees felt it was a better option to continue to hold up the line and create confusion as she kept having to drag her suitcases back and forth. Know when to just cut your losses. Because of the seating issue I was not able to sit with my boyfriend on the second flight. Upon landing, we learned that one of our suitcases was not on the plane, leaving my boyfriend with none of his things. We were told that it would be delivered to our hotel (2 hours away) by the end of the day. I am sceptical, but will see. My own brand new suitcase's retractable handle is now completely broken and won't budge from its retracted position. I was curtly informed that they are not liable for this damage. I have degenerative disc disease in my lower back, so it's very uncomfortable if not painful to try and drag my suitcase around without a retractable handle. So thanks a lot for that, United.

We were lied to, ignored, spoken to rudely. Customer service lines took 3 hours to get to the front of and there was no noticeable attempt to fix it. However, not all of the customer service has been bad.

After a long wait of 3 hours with only a single person to rebook all customers in other flights, we finally got our turn to speak with the staff. We were given only one option that is, ""You have flight only the following day and there are no more available for today"". I understood their situation as they could not provide me with any flight for that day as there are no seats available. After long waits we finally reached home with boarding passes for the following day.  We woke up early again in the morning and checked the status online on United Airlines website. It mentioned there is a delay in flight timings but the scheduled time of departure is still shown at 6.10 am. I thought they will send an email or a text message incase if there is really one. And once again after paying for the cabs and reaching there on time we found that the flight is delayed by 4 hours. I felt deceived. I spoke to an attendant as to why I was not informed about the delay and she told I will get back to me in a moment and went on serving the customers at other kiosk without ever bothering to respond me. I then waited for 15 minutes to speak with another one and she asked how I made my resevation and I explained her it was through Priceline. And she tried to blame them as it is their fault and they have to inform me. I told her that these were new boarding passes which were issued by United Airlines at the kiosk. Her response ""Yeah right. I dont know"". I told her it is not a problem if there is a delay but it is your responsibility to inform me so that I would not have come early. Her response, ""I know but i cant do anything. You could wait at the airport or leave and then come back at around 9.30 am as that is when the boarding starts"". Is she going to pay us for the cabs? Cant they see what efforts we might have gone through to come to airport in the icy conditions with heavy luggage? She then tried to blame the weather when I told her the flight to and from the same locations in Southwest is running at scheduled time. Then she said, ""I don't control anything here. I don't know why the scheduled time in website was not updated"". In the end, I have to leave the counter with frustration.

Same seat as before, but with a bunch more stuff, including a “polar bear” teddy bear, so there’s no space to put anything. Of course, having a teddy bear didn’t guarantee that I’d have a menu (which I had to ask for) nor an amenity kit with ear plugs - which I sorely needed because the guy beside me started to snore loudly just after takeoff. Once the bell indicated that the crew could get out of their seats and start the service, I used the FA call button to ask for an amenity kit to get some ear plugs. The FA working in my section came to me and said that I should not to use the call button because it was loud and would disturb other passengers. His telling me that woke up the guy beside me. So much for not disturbing other passengers. I was amazed and annoyed. I’ve never been told in a premium cabin on any carrier not to use the call button. Why did I have to use the call button? I got on board and had no menu, no amenity kit yet somehow I had a teddy bear, pillow, two blankets and a rude flight attendant who told me to just signal him when he’s in the aisle. I did that and got an arms crossed “what would you like” rude stare. The movie selection consisted of exactly six movies. My tray table would not come out, so I had to leave my seat while the same FA who told me not to use my call button yanked on it to the point where it finally ejected from its slot, but, in the process, toppled over my drink.

There 4 updates given and they were not timely and obviously they were not accurate. We arrived in Chicago at 8:38p.

An announcement was even made that they didn't need to rush. When we landed in Chicago I had to run from gate B14 to E1. I have never run so fast, in heels, in my life. When I arrived at E1 the plane had pulled away. I was livid! I went to a customer service counter for assistance and was told there were no more flights leaving Chicago to Milwaukee that night and that I could take a bus. A bus? I didn't want to but I was ready to go home to say the least. The time then was 9:00pm. I was told the bus wasn't leaving until 10:45p and it was the last bus. Arriving Milwaukee at 12:30am. I inquired about my luggage and was given instructions on how to get it. After going to another service counter, I was able to get my luggage, 20 minutes later. The second service counter attendant told me the bus shuttle was right outside the door and to follow the red Bus Shuttle sign. She even pointed to a Coach bus going by telling me that's where I'd get on the bus. I hadn't been on a bus since I was 12 years old. She offered and gave $20 worth of food vouchers but I didn't use them. I was too distraught. I sat in the terminal waiting to go to the bus stop. At 10:15 something told me to go and find out exactly where I needed to stand. I asked an airport shuttle driver and he told me to follow him. He pointed to shuttles/buses that were across the street and about a 10 minute walk away! I had to run again, this time with luggage. As I entered the bus terminal there was no one available to ask which stop, 4, 5,6, etc, I was supposed to stand near. I asked the transit cop and he told me to stand at #4. I asked what time was the bus coming. He said the bus usually gets there at 10:30pm. My watch said 10:32p. He then said he must be running a little late. I didn't want to take any chances so I stool outside the terminal, right in front of the #4 stand, waiting for the bus. Once on the bus, the driver announced since this was the last bus of the night he had to wait an additional 10 minutes before departing. I arrived at the bus station in Milwaukee WI at 12:38am.

Understandably some passengers were upset because of possible missed connections at SFO, but weather is what it is, and an airline can't help that. Some opted to disembark before we pushed back from the terminal. The pilot was very courteous and apologetic. You could tell he cared as he tried to work whatever magic he could to get us out as early as possible. He was even apologetic over the the way some of the ground crew was apparently dealing with customer concerns which he felt wasn't totally what it should have been. Some things he apparently overheard and apologized for. The cabin crew onboard the flight was pleasant as well (though I think it would have been cool if they had offered water, or peanuts or something as we sat waiting. Since we really didn't know how long it was going to be.) Still I felt the flight and cabin crew handled it as well as they could.

They said it would be a 30 min job. After that, they said they had to change a tire. That was supposed to be another 15mins. After that, they broke a piece and we weren't going anywhere. After that, they got a new piece and we were going. 20 mins after that we were finally in the air. We didn't land in Orlando until after 2pm, when we were supposed to be there at 11am.

One staff member was particularly rude and obnoxious and seemed to enjoy being so. The flight is operated using a Boeing 757. The aircraft is rather comfortable but compact. The safety procedures were taken seriously and a video shown. During this flight I had to contend with an malfunctioning inflight entertainment system. Only a few TVs worked and the sound / volume was not controllable. The journey map did not work properly as only the distances were displayed. The couple next to me gave up on their IFE as theirs’s did not work either. My arm rest was not working correctly either. The catering was good and drinks were served regularly during the flight. I was impressed with the captain who made clear announcements and was very professional and welcoming. The Captain made a point of saying farewell to departing passengers in person. I had to collect my second boarding pass in Newark and the first uniformed United staff member I spoke to was indifferent and made no effort to even speak to me but pointed me along the concourse.

After a few minutes, they referred me back to the idle gate (which we could see no one was there). Realizing that this was idiotic, I walked to one of the other NYC bound flight gates as we have 3 major airports in the US's busiest city. The good news was that there was a half empty flight leaving in 30 minutes! The bad news was that United said it would be too difficult to swap with such short notice.

The lady was kind enough to tell me that my overbooked flight (which I have a ticket for) is going to be 2 hours late though. I fly for work every week. I have to take the cheapest airline as a company policy. Why can American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and even Frontier figure it out, yet 100% of the time, United has excuses and animosity towards its customers?

On top of the $200 United already wanted me to pay, they were going to charge me an additional $200 to change the flight, $100 to book the flight through United and not a travel agent.

My flight back home from LA however is another story! My flight was at 9:55, my friend and I were waiting at the gate (the gate listed on United's app which was verified by the employee's of the airport). At 10:00 we are looking at each other wondering why boarding or no announcements were made on the PA system. We go to customer service to find out that they made a last minute gate change (this happens often in airports and I've never had a problem catching flights using the App or listening to PA system). We were told we could be put on standby for the last flight that evening or have seats for an 8am flight the next day. Due to the fact that the gate change was not announced or alerted through the app we were not the only passengers having this problem. We later realized that they never made the announcement because they have over booked multiple flights and needed extra seats! After we were not able to get on our standby flight - due to overbooking, they asked for volunteers to give up their seats to be able to fit other passengers- We had to sleep in the airport (we asked for hotel accommodation and were told we would be reimbursed however the ""volunteers"" got vouchers right away). After sleeping in the freezing cold airport and finally boarding our flight, while giving our boarding passes we were told our reservation was canceled!

The whole experience was horrible and my wife and I were glad it was almost done with when we landed in SFO, our transfer point back to Tucson. Unfortunately it wasn't. I am now waiting for an hour or more for my bags as our flight was cancelled and I am now booked for another flight tomorrow to Denver and then finally Tucson (lets hope). The service reps were the most rude and unfriendly I have ever met and nothing was done to help us after the cancelled our flight. To make matters worse our flight was cancelled awhile before we were ever notified. The costs we are incurring due to them is not worth any amount of saved money for a cheaper ticket and we now have 12 hours of flying to get from Cancun to Tucson not counting the several hours of layovers.

Breakdown of review categories: Value for money is lowest possible because I don't find any value in their service. The price was good for our flight if they met any expectation but failed in all categories. Ground and Air Service were both rude and I would have given the air service one star if it wasn't for the ground service being significantly worse comparably.

Air traffic control delays at Bogota meant a 25 minute delay arriving into Houston. This flight was operated with a Boeing 737-700 and was packed. Cabin crew were ok if not somewhat lackadaisical. Perhaps it was the midnight departure. Announcements were barely audible. For inflight entertainment, this plane was equipped with DirectTV rather than the airline's far superior wifi delivered personal device entertainment. This meant having to pay to view the only 8 movies available - as the rest of DirectTV's content library is inaccessible outside the continental USA. Big Fail. The cabin was uncomfortably warm throughout the flight and coupled with the older seats, tight pitch and full load made it far less pleasant and also difficult to catch any shut eye. Strangely, a full meal is served on this sector at about 1.30am, which to be honest, wasn't bad. Made me wonder why our outbound to Panama from Newark of a similar duration and more appropriate departure time for a meal service, offered no complimentary catering. The crew did a few water runs until arrival in Houston. Transfer at Houston took longer than I expected owing to slow immigration clearance. However, I boarded the next flight with ample time to settle in. This aircraft was a Boeing 737-900ER with the newer seats, sky interior and wifi delivered entertainment. What a difference. It just felt more spacious. Seats were a bit more comfortable and legroom seemed to be better. Perception is everything I guess. The crew this time were sunnier, cheerful and seemed pleased to be onboard. Pushback was right on time and arrival 18 minutes early.

This last flight was clearly the best of 3 I took with United over the last 10 days.

In terms of full-blown, memorable personalised service, it probably is a little below the level of other airlines. Also, there's some cost cutting aspects which became apparent after a while. I asked for another bowl of nuts some way into the flight and was told ""We're out of nuts."" I asked for a snack and was told that they put out sandwiches and snacks, but only at the half-way point of the journey. So it seemed that they have some limitations, presumably to ensure that the cost per passenger per flight doesn't exceed a certain amount. The seats were good an modern.

Customer service at Newark reaffirmed the airline would not foot the bill for a hotel because of those reasons for delay. I had travel insurance so was not worried about that too much. Eventually took off and once onboard, crew were fine and reasonably friendly. They waived the DirectTV fee due to the delay.

I asked a United ground staff person how we get to Toronto and showed her my ticket, and she proceeded to send us to Terminal 5 - which is outside the security area and at the far end of the airport. This required taking the train, walking a fair distance, and once we arrived the ground staff at the entrance to this terminal advised us we needed to return to Terminal 1! Needless to say, we were not happy. Our flight was scheduled to depart 1 hour after we arrived at this airport (Chicago) and when we finally cleared security (again) and made our way back, the flight was already boarded and our overhead bins were full. And we were flying in seat 2b and 2d (I may have the seat numbers incorrect, but you get the idea - we were again in Business class.) This flight was a treat - the flight attendants were very pleasant, and had to deal with my ranting about being sent all over the airport by United ground staff.

Flight departed and arrived on time. The flight Newark - Los Angeles a full flight, but the flight attendants were there with good, cheerful service, with water, beverages, even a decent hot meal for purchase that was better than expected. The leg room in economy plus was adequate in bulkhead seats - overall it gave me hope that United is trying to improve its service and on time performance.

However, when we printed out our boarding pass the day before the flight, United had left my wife with the window seat but moved me about 25 yards back in the 5-seat section. We were shocked. There was no change of equipment, which might have explained it. No explanation, no apology. When we got to the airport, I said to the attendant at our gate that we chose our seats well in advance, so by rights those two seats together should be ours. She gave me a sly smile and said, in effect, ""No, you have no right to those seats. United retains the right to reassign seating for no reason or any reason, and that's what we've done.""

When I went to use the restroom before our flight, the restrooms were disgusting. When an United employee finally came to our gate and I expressed my concern that not only were we severely delayed and sitting in the dark with an absurd noise level, but now there weren't even restroom facilities available, she told me there was nothing she could do and dismissed me. Due to United's delay, our arranged transportation home from the Newark airport had to be adjusted causing significant inconvenience.  I could not believe the lack of communication, unsanitary conditions, disorganization, and the complete lack of professionalism we experienced from United. It was the worst experience and a complete disgrace at the end of our honeymoon.

On August 30th I get an automated email saying that my flight is scheduled as planned. I noticed that they had the wrong time of flight in the email. So, I went online and verified the correct flight time (a flight at the time they sent me didn't exist). When I arrived at the airport and began the check-in process there was no record of me in the system. The kiosks gave me ""not found"" and the personnel at the counters confirmed the same. My flight was in two hours and I was starting to panic. I called United Airlines and got an agent. I explained my situation, told the agent that it was urgent and I was about to miss my flight, and asked if I could speak to a supervisor. The agent put me on a very long hold and then disconnected me. After a number of similar calls to the call center I finally got an agent - an hour later - that told me that somebody at UA had deleted my record from the system on the morning of my flight and I no longer had a seat on that plane. Really UA? Wow. Given the number of long holds, disconnects, and agents not able to correctly diagnose and resolve the problem from the start, I missed my flight. I had to take a later flight that day which made a mess of my plans. I will not use United Airlines again. It bends my mind that an airline could simply remove a paying customer from a confirmed flight without notification and leave him to sort out the mess at check-in. A mess that was met, not with any apologies or concern for my predicament, but with endless hold times, disconnects, and supervisors that are ""too busy at the moment"".

I came four hours before my flight, I was going to work from the airport.

It is generally true for United that things were better in pre-Continental merger but it all ain't that bad either. I have flown the B767-400ER and B777 on several transatlantic routes this summer in both classes. I was surprised at how much more comfortable the B764 was as compared to the B777. The B777 felt packed (3-3-3 configuration in coach and awkward backward facing seats in business), while the B764 felt very spacious, clean and modern (2-3-2 in coach and 2-1-2 in business, all forward facing and not too many seats, so quieter). There were also no bothersome IFE equipment boxes under the window seats in coach. I would recommend searching routes that operate the B764 over the B777 - I really believe it is superior in terms of cabin layout and passenger comfort. BusinessFirst very comfortable flat bed seats (I am 179cm). Food quality ok, the main course was very good (beef with steamed vegetables) as well as the cheese and desert (nice detail they cut the cheese at your seat, so it feels fresh). The starter salad was very uncreative and plain bad actually, and no olive oil option as a dressing. But OK, it's an US airline so just don't expect any proper food to come out of that. Food in coach was also good with 3 separate serving rounds for appetiser, meal and desert+coffee. Great idea to hand out water bottles before the sleeping phase of the flight. Next time I will opt for the express dining option in business, as the full dining service takes so much time that you have little left for sleeping. Some people argue the seat configuration in business should be 1-2-1 rather than 2-1-2, but I disagree, while 1-2-1 is perfect for solo business travelers as everyone has isle access, I feel that when traveling with my partner (or any other person) I want to sit together by the window, so 2-1-2 does make sense to me. The business experience in United may not be up to the standards of European and Asian carriers, but (at least on my flights) you also pay less, so I think it offers great value for money.

This was one of my leisure travels where I was traveling with family and a younger sibling. BusinessFirst"" does consist of nice lie flat beds, you can lie flat and sleep for the most part; as well as the meals being consistently nice. This is something that I can say that United has done well over the past few years. As for the negatives. The businessfirst cabin is cramped.  Cram as many people together as close together to the point you can't but help to stare at your neighbors. Economy plus has a little bit more legroom but hardly worth the extra money if you have to pay for it. This older 767 has dated IFE, screens that are 4 inches wide and may you be lucky if they work. Seats in Econ+ are old, and often broken and hindered in legroom by the IFE boxes. That being said there is extreme value in the price of a UA ticket. The tickets are often $200 cheaper than competing airlines. Furthermore the cabins are grungy, dirty and not clean. You notice a felling of stale air and dirt the second you come into the cabin. I flew with my sibling who is a minor, very much a minor as he is still in elementary school. He was booked in United Economy on an award ticket, I in United Businessfirst paid. I asked the United Agents at checkin if he could sit with me in the business cabin as there where plenty of seats in the cabin still available. I was declined  because of the ""scarcity"" of meals  and asked once again when boarded if he could take an empty seat. The purser was kind enough to ask and with some humiliation, when I pressed him for an answer, he answered that there were not enough seats. As for experience onboard with the staff, it can vary 50/50. Staff are usually quite friendly in the business cabin; but this can also be a polar opposite with glaring stares, cold shoulder treatment and curt responses. Delays on United are not a surprise, they are the rule. I have missed countless engagements, meetings etc because of United's inability to stick to schedule. Again this flight was no different. We boarded, and were advised there was a faulty fresh water valve failure. We were on board for 1 hour before the pursers and FAs advised us to deplane and wait outside whilst they resolved the issue or found a resolution. I went to sit in the Global First Lounge - every other lounge that I've been to is nicer - to await the resolution. Another 3 hours progresses before we are able to board another plane (aircraft swap) to continue on our way to Amsterdam.

We were also given a blanket which was nice because the plane did get a bit chilly as our flight was early morning. Once, we took off the flight was bump free and smooth as it got. I have been on many flights and have done this flight numerous times with many airlines. This flight had to be the smoothest I have been on. Overall the only thing I wish they had was actual food on the flight and working wifi but the latter cant be blamed on United.

,United Airlines,Business Class,August 2016,18th August 2016,3,3,1,Australia,2.0,no,"✅ , |  My wife and I have just returned from a trip to the USA (Newark to Sydney via San Francisco) flying United Airlines business class. We’ve flown a lot over the years but have never experienced an airline service quite as bad as this one. After a long flight from Sydney we faced a 6-hour delay in San Francisco awaiting a connection to Chicago. At one point we boarded a plane and were preparing for take-off. The plane was actually waiting on the runway for the go ahead to fly. Astoundingly, we get a cabin announcement informing us that we were to be taken back to the terminal as the pilot had gone over his assigned ‘flight hours’ and couldn’t fly the plane. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Confusion reigned for the next few hours while United staff gave conflicting information. Firstly, we were told to stay on the plane and wait for a replacement pilot. We were then told we’d need to disembark. One said we'd definitely be flying that day while another said we might not as they might not be able to get a pilot. Eventually, a pilot did arrive and we did fly out that day. Unfortunately, the return leg didn’t improve. We were scheduled to fly from Newark airport to San Fran where we would catch another flight to Sydney. As time was tight between when the flight from Newark was due to arrive and our connection from San Fran was due to depart, we decided to arrive at Newark airport early to see if we could change to an earlier flight. We were told by a rather surly United staff member that all earlier flights were fully booked. Strangely – when I checked my baggage in, the check in screen told me that for $75.00 I could take an earlier flight. After passing security, we decided to go to the United lounge and ask service staff about any other options for taking an earlier flight. When staff saw the tight connection time between the two flights they were in disbelief. They told us that this was an illegal connection and we should not have been able to even book it. They then offered to put us on standby and as it happened, we were able to get an earlier flight. On arrival at San Fran, my wife noted that an email had been sent to her from her work. When we hadn’t boarded our ‘booked’ flight from Newark our flight from San Francisco to Sydney had been cancelled. Service staff confirmed this and notified that our booked seats had already been sold and we might not be able to get seats on the flight. We were eventually assigned new seats but we might as well have saved our money and gone economy. Passengers were walking through the cabin all night and we had to put up with a screaming baby and the stench of diaper changes. The service was woeful and I’ve had better in economy on other airlines. Our seats hadn’t been cleaned properly - there was rubbish and the screen control device was so sticky and dirty my wife had to wipe it down herself. Finally, when we arrived in Sydney we went to the baggage claim. After waiting an hour for our baggage we decided to check where it might be. Surprise, our baggage was still in San Fran. This despite asking United staff numerous times that our luggage was on the flights and receiving their full assurances. The service person in Sydney noted it was a common occurrence with United. When we turned around there was a line of United customers with the same issue. I realise others have had far worse flight experience, but ours wasn’t great. You come away with the feeling that the dollar is definitely a priority over the customer.",EWR to SYD via SFO,2,3,united-airlines,you couldn’t make this stuff up,Couple Leisure,,1,0,2c1b4a94-bd4b-4c4c-a84b-b60d2f5e2532

I understand weather related issues and the 1 hr delay but once again the communication with United is just terrible and don’t get me started on the attitude from the United personnel. They kept us on the plane for more than 1 hour because they couldn’t move the gate bridge and maintenance was working on it. After weather and Gate Bridge delays, we left 140 minutes late but the problem is that 40 minutes after takeoff, pilot announcement was extremely disconcerting. “Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a problem because we are getting some warning signs and the Autopilot doesn’t work so we will have to get back to the closest mayor airport but we will not declare any emergency”. Once again having problems, I don’t know if it’s just me that I travel too much or just bad luck. Unfortunately I have had more and more issues with United and for once I realize status doesn’t mean anything as some United representatives are rude and disrespectful and they can’t resolve problems. I guess I didn’t get any compensation because I decided to cancel my trip as I was only going to be in Brazil for 36 hrs after all of this issue. I had 3 customers by themselves in Brazil and this was really costly to the company but I guess United doesn’t really care about it. If this was a onetime thing, from time to time, it would be fine, but its almost every international overseas flight a take (7-8 a year) and then, several domestics as well.

On the way down to Honduras, there was no issues except that the personal in-flight entertainment wasn't working for some of the flight down to Houston, which wasn't a big deal because I brought myself plenty of things to do. Both the flights from Denver and Houston left on time, and the flight from Denver arrived a little early. Coming back wasn't quite as smooth. I checked in online and printed boarding passes from the hotel's computer rather than doing it at the airport. However, the airport staff in San Pedro Sula wanted the version printed from the airport (not United's fault). What my biggest gripe is that once I get to the ticket counter, I am rudely told that since I already have a boarding pass, they can't print me another one. Luckily, I was able to eventually get to the secure part of the airport. Then when I am trying to board, the ground service rejects the boarding pass which I printed off of the United website, and almost wouldn't let me board. After a few minutes of verification, they finally let me board, but first give me a lecture about ""not having a boarding pass"". Overall, all the flights were fine. The cabin crew were all very friendly, and since I have the United App, I could access the personal entertainment, which had a good selection of movies. They offered drinks, and the service was done very quickly. The legroom was a little tight, but the seats themselves were comfortable and the airplane was clean.

Circumstances caused my friend to have to change to an earlier flight and leave for California without me. Since I had made all travel arrangements I called United's customer service line to make the changes. They said it would cost $200 to change flights. I said that was no problem and they gave me a departure time and flight number. I got off the phone relieved that I was able to get a flight for him at the correct time. Some time later I realized that I had not been asked for any payment information. That couldn't be right so I called customer service back and spoke with an agent who assured me that the flight was confirmed and paid for. I repeated to her that I was supposed to be charged $200. She said somebody must've made a mistake and I got lucky. I was told I would receive confirmation by email. Over an hour passed and no email. Called customer service again. I was told that they didn't know why I didn't get the email and again assured me that everything was confirmed. Next morning we drove over an hour from Colorado Springs to the Denver airport.

My negative experiences with the airline date back to 2007. As for the present trip under review from New York LaGuardia to Chicago, here are the most relevant issues. First, the flight was delayed leaving the airport by over two hours. There was no explanation given for what led to the delay while we waited at the gate. Second, the space between seats is simply unfairly small. I am a 5' 10"" man who is not at all overweight. And yet, my knees were pressed firmly against the seat in front of me, and the space was so small that I could not open my laptop computer to do work on the flight (my laptop is a MacBook Air, the thinnest model). Third, once in Chicago airspace we were told we could not land and circled the airport for close to an hour. When it finally appeared that we were going to land, the landing was aborted at the very last moment and were re-routed to Detroit. The problem: no information was given that we were heading there, just a little surprise when we arrived at a different airport. Upon exiting the plane, there were no gate agents there to help with booking connecting flights, only the personnel who dealt with lost luggage. I could actually say more negative things about this flight but am limited by space. Suffice it to say that I will absolutely never fly United again unless they are literally the only option in getting to my destination city.

The cabin made an outdated impression and signs of abrasion were found everywhere; cables fixed with tape, worn armrests and not working lights were just a few of them. The cabin staff was split half-in-half: 50 per cent were very friendly and seemed to care about passengers, however, the other half behaved like their job is a tremendous burden for them and customers seen as a factor of distress. The selection of food found in the menu was good but the quality of the served meals was bluntly put an impertinence; especially the meat was flavourless and rubber-like. The beverages were much better, though the coffee was another letdown.

I fly United a lot, because I live in Chicago and have the opportunity to collect miles and other benefits. Generally, I've been satisfied with this arrangement. I'm not unrealistic about United - you definitely don't get the small luxuries that Asian and some European airlines provide, but United generally provides competent, reliable service, and most staff members are reasonably friendly. Recent flights to and from GRU were par for the course. The flights were on time. Staff were efficient. The economy plus seats were fine. The small screens on the 767s are pretty bad, but I understand why it might not be worth updating them. I don't eat meat and have learned that ""Asian vegetarian"" tends to be better quality than regular vegetarian. The ""Asian vegetarian"" suppers were reasonable in both directions, although there was nothing at all Asian about the GRU to ORD supper (soy burgers plus rice and vegetables). The ORD to GRU supper was quite good and (except maybe for the curried tofu) quite South Asian. It even came with plain yogurt. However, United should be embarrassed by the breakfasts (in both directions), which consisted entirely of a stale roll and a tiny package of jam. People who didn't request a special meal got a croissant and a sweetened yogurt, which would have been just as ""Asian vegetarian"" as what I did get. My seatmate who (unlike me) is actually South Asian was just furious. This is the sort of thing that undermines United's improving reputation. Asian and most European airlines are much more generous about breakfasts and usually provide vegetarians (and everyone else) with a full meal. Let me add that I complained about the breakfast on the GRU to ORD flight to an FA as gently as I could, and she very nicely supplied me with a regular breakfast. I urged my seatmate to do the same, and he just got angrier. I appreciated the reasonable-quality wine that United is now distributing for free in economy.

Service was appalling, other than the wider seat, it may as well have been a coach trip. Shortly after take off, I asked one of the flight attendants for a second serving of nuts, to my shock, she said (actually ""snipped"" was more like it) ""no, we have only one serving per person"". For a first class ticket, you can't get a second thimble of nuts? When lunch was served, it seemed like it took forever,  two or three passengers were served after which there were long intervals before the next few passengers were served. There were those who were finishing before we'd even started. As to the preparation - there was not even an attempt to cover the fold up trays with a linen of any kind and the food was not good - unappetizing coach grade cafeteria fare. Internet in both directions was available for a charge - something like $3.99/hour. This, I've never heard of especially in first class. Nonetheless, I paid for the entire flight and could not get it to work in either direction. $20.00 wasted. The condition of the plane felt ok, solid and relatively new - though the electric plug at my seat was loose, and wouldn't hold a cord, the entire socket tipped out with the weight of the electric cord so that was unusable as well.

Let me put it this way: I would have gotten to NYC sooner if I drove the whole way. I was only supposed to be traveling for about 6 hours during the day, but this trip with United required an entire day of traveling. I left Tampa around noon, and didn't get in to NYC until 2 in the morning the next day. On top of that, they managed to lose my luggage, and they still haven't found it after a day. My flight was continuously delayed until eventually they randomly decided to cancel it. I had to wait in the customer service line for well over an hour, and the representatives I tried calling were so unhelpful - it turned out there was actually an open seat on an alternate flight with a different airline leaving at an earlier time, but they didn't realize this until too late and ended up re-booking me for a red-eye flight flying out of a different airport. So I had to spend $30 for a shuttle ride to the different airport which took well over an hour. Once I got there, even the new red-eye flight got delayed by over 2 hours.

Many of these delays are mechanical or personnel in nature (awaiting pilot or crew). Obviously, when you are so heavily invested with an airline, they've got you.

Only once did we actually have a place to put our feet, only once did we not have to sit and watch 200 plus people board and crash into our seats, and only once did we have television screen to watch a movie. Also not even a pre-loaded movie device was provided on our way home from San Francisco to Chicago. Also on that flight, even though we had the first two seats on the plane, when breakfast was served, I received oatmeal instead of the omelette that I had requested.

Having read many negative reviews and horror stories of United Airlines, I went in with lowered expectations. The flights overall turned out okay, even though it was eventful and I did encounter problems like flight diversion and flight and baggage delays. First, UA6. The personal screen on the 772 was touchscreen and not very big. The touchscreen was not sensitive, and the system was not very user-friendly. That said, they have a decent repertoire of entertainment, even though they may not always be the latest (e.g. movies). The food turned out better than I expected, but this assumes you made the right choices (on my return flight, to be separately reviewed, I made the wrong choices). First meal (dinner) was chicken with rice, second meal (breakfast) was chicken and egg with rice, Japanese style. Both were actually good. Ice cream (vanilla) was served after the first meal, and in between the 12-hour flight they served drinks and also a burger. However, only the salad was horrible - edamame beans should not be served as a salad. Service was decent too - remember, if you are nice to the flight attendant (e.g. you are polite to them), they will also be nice to you. Seat was reasonably comfortable too. Unfortunately for this flight, bad weather at Houston caused us to divert to Austin, where we waited on the tarmac to refuel, and some snacks were distributed while waiting. This caused us to land at Houston eventually 3 hours late - and we thought we missed our connecting flight. Next, UA1461. We thought we would miss this flight, which was due to depart almost 3 hours after UA6 was supposed to land (If it was on time) at Houston. However this flight was also delayed, so we managed to rush on despite arriving late and being caught in security checks and waiting for baggage which did not arrive on the belt. Not the airline's fault, but do check with Houston airport staff if your baggage needs to be collected at the luggage belt at Houston to be re-checked, because ours didn't need to be but we did not know. This flight was on a newer 738, but no in-flight entertainment. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a pasta, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). Flight was delayed presumably by bad weather at Houston, but also because they were slow with loading the luggage (I could see from my window they were still loading the luggage even past the departure time). In the end, unfortunately my luggage did not make it from my delayed UA6 to my delayed UA1461, and I had to proceed to their airport staff at San Salvador airport to lodge a case. I have to give them credit for being rather efficient in locating my luggage, putting it on the next flight that night, and delivering it to me the next day by noon - this whole process could have gone much worse, so I am glad it was well-handled. Overall, UA did not turn out as bad as I had expected it to be for my first time, even though I did experience my first diversion and delayed luggage, despite having flown regularly for many years with other airlines.",NRT to SAL via IAH,4,4,united-airlines,seat was reasonably comfortable,Business,,4,0,b6369ab9-29f6-4269-9b6e-ddcce21334a6

First, UA1541. Surprised to see that there was a personal screen, but it was with DirecTV and pre-recorded movies, and not available free of charge. However, in the end movies were made available free of charge, presumably due to slight delays on the ground at the start of the flight. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a wrap, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). I had wanted the sandwich but it was out of stock. Next, UA1699. In-flight entertainment was miles ahead since it was newer, though I notice the selection was less compared to my next sector which was a 16-hour international flight. Food was available for purchase, though the usual snacks and drinks were available free-of-charge. I did not buy anything, and survived on a zesty snack pack with Sprite. My seat was supposed to be window seat, but the window was misaligned so I had to lean forward to gaze outside. It was great to have no one sitting next to me in the middle, which enhanced the amount of space available considering that the Dreamliner in 3-3-3 seating is known to be rather cramped. Finally, UA1, newly launched earlier this month. I had expected it to be very painful to fly 16 hours on a cramped 787. It turned out to be uncomfortable but still bearable. Managed to get some light sleep, managed to be sufficiently entertained too. What failed me was the food. The first meal (dinner), I made the wrong choice and had a (vegetarian, but you dont know until you get it) pasta with just spinach, cheese and tomato sauce. Salad was as usual horrible. Luckily the ice-cream saved the day. In between I missed the turkey ham roll as I was asleep, but it was available at the back of the plane for self-service. That was helpful to stave off hunger pangs. The second meal (breakfast) was literally the worst in-flight meal I ever had. I did not have a choice as they had run out of the eggs, so there was only a (vegetarian again) noodle in some funky weird black sauce, with weird tasting mushroom, edamame (horrible again) and red pepper. Absolute disaster, so bad that my neighbour and I did not finish the food. Without the bun and butter I would have starved. Seat comfort-wise, legroom and width was okay though my friend who was a bit bigger sized and seated at the aisle could feel a significant narrower seat width compared to the other flights - his shoulders were up against the neighbour in the middle seat. Overall, service and food on board seemed to be not as good as my outbound flights from NRT to SAL via IAH, though the in-flight entertainment was better on the newer Dreamliner.

Despite an early landing in Milan, due to the lenghty custom procedures and the unavailability of the United Airlines personnel to assist me in expediting the process, despite my desperate running through the airport, I reached the gate too late for boarding. I had to take the later flight at 3.55. I missed a meeting in Orlando. The staff at the UA customer service desk were very unpleasant and were not be co-operative at all. I have to add that the 8.5 hour flight from MXP to Newark was also very unconfortable with poor quality food and noisy company. I complained to customer service and received a free ticket for a future flight with United for the value of 150 US Dollars. However, 6 days later, when on my way back to Italy from Florida I asked the UA personnel at MCO-Orlando to upgrade my ticket from Newark to Milano Malpensa UA19 to a business class ticket. The attendant at the counter told me that there were seats available, but an upgrade for my ticket was not available nor could I use the free ticket United gave me. If I wished to fly business class, I had to buy a new ticket.

Of course, only on an American carrier do I find myself being spoken rudely to by member of the cabin crew. After boarding and taking my seat 2A (single seat by the window), I went to use the forward lavatory. The cockpit door was wide open with the captain, a young woman, sitting sideways in her seat. I greeted her and we started chatting. She was very interested to hear of several recent flights I’d had on the new A350 operated by QR. The FA in the first galley, interrupted me to say, “excuse me sir, you are in my space”. I replied, “I’m speaking with the captain” and moved slightly closer to the lavatory door. The captain and I chatted for a few more moments, then I went into the lavatory. Before the lavatory door was even shut, I heard the FA staying loudly to the captain, “I’m sorry, he just started talking to you”. I came out of the lavatory and said, “What is it that you are sorry for? I can speak to the captain before the door is closed and we push back from the gate. She was quite happy to have a conversation with me”. The FA said nothing. I went to my seat. The FA then came to ask me if I wanted something to drink pre-departure. I told her that it was rude of her to say what she said to the captain in a loud voice and that she could, at the least, have said once I was out of earshot. Before I had even finished speaking she just walked away from me. She came back to my seat and I asked her, “do you always just walk away while a passenger is speaking to you”.

The choices were between Air India and United. As we have tried Air India before, and we have not flown long haul with United for a long time, we decided to try out United's much touted ""new cabin experience"" in Economy class, where a ""three course meal"" would be presented, as well as improved services for Economy passengers. We had hoped United had improved since the last, disastrous time we flew them in 2013, but alas. It is the same lacklustre airline. Check in at EWR was relatively painless, and the TSA, is the TSA. We boarded and left relatively on time, and so far, things looked alright. And we were wrong about that. The 777-200 was old, to say the least, and in a shabby condition. The seats were worn and my recline didn't work- needless to say, for a 14 hour flight, this was simply not good enough, United. I was given a free drink to compensate, but a drink doesn't help you when you're stuck in an upright and uncomfortable position for 14 hours at 6 feet 3. My second gripe with this flight was the crew - and what a surly bunch they were. The ""three course meal"" much touted was not there - instead, we got served an awful mix of barbecue sauce and chicken, rice, and uncooked vegetables. There was no initial drinks run, and everything was served on one, tiny tray and due to this, our portion sizes were far too small. My son (aged 9) didn't eat anything for 12 hours. Breakfast was little better, with a choice between an uncooked omelette and an Indian vegetarian meal. The only saving grace of this flight was the IFE, but the screens were worn and did not respond to touch controls and the remotes in the armrest did not work. We have flown flights of similar length on Qatar or Emirates, and it is important to note how wonderful the food was, on those 16 hour voyages, and the plentiful snacks (I say ""snacks"", they were literally meals), and the courteous crews. There was none of that on a United flight of similar, or even longer length. The abysmal meals, disinterested and indifferent crews (who were nowhere to be seen after the initial meal service), and the shabby, worn condition of the plane and seats mean that I do not recommend United on such long haul flights of more than 10 hours.

I was looking forward to my first time flying with United in an International leg. I have enjoyed their Domestic/Transborder route quite a few times. I've read on their website the improvement they made on their in-flight services so I was excited to experience it. But I knew my excitement will short-lived when I stepped into the boarding lunge to take my flight. Announcements after announcements were made by the gate agent that the flight will be full and that all big carry on must be check in. The boarding process itself was chaotic and the UA gate agents in SFO seemed annoyed and you can hardly see anyone smiling and genuinely greeting travelers as they board. They all look like they just want to get the boarding over and pass it on to the flight crew to deal with the guest. Once onboard, I was looking for the ""Plus"" in what United called their "" Economy Plus"" seats section.

Seats looks and smells dirty and really really old. I am a short person (5'6) and my knees almost touch the seat in front of me.There is also in IFE box under the seat in front which limits my legroom. Food service was the one I was anticipating and see how United made an improvement. The first meal service was a total disappointment. I wish I am lying right now when I say the food was horrible and inedible. I didn't finish my meal and only consumed the bread and veggies. THe second meal service was even worse. Noodles with no meat and it was so salty. Inflight entertainment is OK but on this aircraft, you have to download their Apps beforehand on your mobile device or else you will watch the Big Screen TV only that shows movie every 3hours.

I have never gone so far as to publically give a rating or review in my 45 years of being on this earth. However, sorry to say I just had to this time. We recently were returning from vacation where my sons anxiety disorder worsened considerably and we had to get home quickly. We had the worst flying experience in all of our flying history. We had never flown United before. Never will again. My son has a medical issue as I mentioned. I planned ahead and paid for premium seats to assure we were all sitting together. Our flight before that came in with about 10 minutes to spare for us to board this connecting flight. By the time we got there, people were still in line to board. However, the desk agent ""removed"" us from the trip. They quickly realized that this decision was a little premature so they offered us some open seat tickets. None of course were next to each other. However, this is why I spent an hour on the phone with United the night before...to make sure we were together in case something happened with my son. I asked if they would be willing to talk to the other customers(travelers) and see if anyone would be willing to switch seats with us as it was the agent who removed us in the first place. He simply walked away. When he came back, I asked if we could resolve this. Apparently the lady next to him was already assigning the extra tickets now to someone else. We now with no choice of our own had to wait for the next flight which I luckily had pre-booked the night before just in case we truly did miss the connection. Only because united had sent us an email that the first flight was already delayed by an hour and a half. All during the process of this the desk agent kept talking to other people, never once apologized for the stress he was causing. He was extremely rude, and said that unless my son has a heart issue or has an oxygen tank that it wasnt his problem. When my son heard this, it immediately hit a nerve and the guilt of us having to deal with this agent in this way and the frustratingly awful customer service sent my son into a debilitating anxiety attack (looks like a seizure). Yet still the agent continued to be defensive. Not one apology, or assistance from anyone at that desk. Clearly, the trouble I had for over an hour on the phone with United the night before made no difference. When I asked if there was someone I could speak with to get further assistance I was told ""yeah, its called online'. Once we boarded, the level of professionalism was atrocious. The flight attendants could be heard talking about the men they dated, rammed the drink cart along passenger seats multiple times, could barely be bothered to actually listen to your order, forget about asking for a blanket.

She then said go sort yourself out at the gate. we got to the gate, and waited for someone to assist us at the service desk. When someone finally appeared. We asked if they could help us with the seating arrangements, because how could they seat a child on their own. We were told they couldn't help with seating arrangements we needed to go to the ticketing desk, which was on the other side of the terminal! we were told we can go ask people to move so we could sit next to my daughter. Frustrating! Then before boarding we were stopped by the gate boarding attendant and was told we had too many bags! We are allowed two bags per person. There was four of us, we had seven bags. She made my mum ruffle around to consolidate our bags, but I told the attendant that my daughter is a person and we paid full price for her, She (my daughter) is allowed two bags! 2x4=8! The attendant then looked at me blankly and just let us through not even apologising for her mistake! Rude! A week later my parents return trip from Oklahoma was booked with United airlines. When they got there (their English is limited) they asked for assistance with the self check in. The two ladies that went to help them, told my parents they had too many bags. Again! My mum had two bags, dad the same. Mum was holding her jacket and a travel pillow for the flight. They bullied my parents to the point, that my mum said she didn't want any more hassle and was happy to pay for the baggage fee. My mum had only cash, but they told my mum they don't accept cash, only credit card! By this time it was almost boarding time for them, then a supervisor of the airline came to see what was the fuss, the supervisor told my parents that they can go because they have the correct amount of bags - just plain rudeness!

The Boeing 772 service to LAX was fully loaded, boarding was orderly, except that the cabin crew did nothing to assist disabled passengers to get seated and sorted before the rest of us got on. It was the same with disembarkation at LAX, so the aisles were brought to a standstill by poor people with physical limits trying to get on and off with the rest of us. The 772 was old and showing it. Things did not work. My IFE system went on the fritz. An FA willingly reset it and then checked, and when it still did not recover, gave me a coupon which I later used online to add 5,000 points to my Mileage Plus account. The inflight wifi also did not work for me 90 percent of the time, but my neighbour could use it it, albeit with very slow up and down speeds. One has to apply online for a refund. The Boeing 787 LAX-MEL was still new and fully functional, and this time the food was edible, though the portions were minuscule, and with dinner service about 1 hour after lift off and breakfast about 1 hour before landing, the 12-13 hours without food in between seemed long, even to me who is not a big eater, though one can buy food from the food for purchase menu. The crew on this leg were short on customer service skills, barking out requests, never a ""please"" or ""thank you"" and not a single hydration round. They seemed pretty sour about something, but when I went to the rear galley to find an empty restroom, a few of them were sitting around and chatting in a very jovial way with each other. Toilets not maintained at all for the 15 hours. Even so, we were on time, things went efficiently, the IFE choices were good, and the IFE system on the B789 was very good. If the hard product on the old 772s is upgraded and the effort to promote customer service skills among cabin crew continues, the improvement in United's service I've noticed over the last couple of years might just continue.

This should not be allowed and after complaining they gave us 3 together. Service onboard was much better than the international flight with great attendants. 3rd internal flight Miami to Newark the worst with very rude staff on the check-in desk who ignored us for about 10-15 minutes.

We were then stranded in the bus for 35 minutes with no explanation, and not allowed to get off the bus. In other words, United doubled down on its incompetence and unreliability by further inconveniencing its passengers by directing them to board a bus and then demonstrating what I construe as willful and intentional contempt for the passengers by stranding them in the bus with no explanation.

Then she pointed out that I had a checked bag and so I was definitely not getting on this flight. I raised my voice out of despair, and explained to her that I had spent 15 minutes trying to figure out their machines. I was even the one who ""apologized"" saying it wasn't her fault.

In our departure flight, when we wanted to check in at SFO, United staff told us that United would not deliver our baggage in our final destination and we would need to pick up our baggage in our second stop, Dubai. When we tried to pick up our baggage in Dubai, airport staff said UAE visa is required to go to baggage claim area and since we did not have UAE visa, they didn't allow us to pick up our baggage. After lots of negotiations and asking several people for advice, we found out that we would need to pay $84 to transfer our baggage. Our flight back to US was supposed to be operated by Austrian Airlines (we bought the round-trip ticket from United) with 2 stops in Vienna and Zurich. When we went to airport, Austrian Airlines staff didn't allow us to check in. They said that flight from Vienna to Zurich is a domestic flight in European Union and would require Schengen Visa. So, we had to reschedule our flight with Lufthansa, we paid $1000 and could get another flight for 2 days later. If United had informed us about those issues when we bought the ticket or even at the airport, none of those problems would have happened. I asked United to reimburse us for all those extra costs but they only offered us two $150 flight certificates, which are basically useless, most of the time United tickets are more expensive than other flights and those $150 dollar certificates hardly have $20 cash value each. They don’t even have a phone number for complaints. The only way you can contact them for complaints, is email or voicemail. I think they have so many complaints that they cannot handle, so they have decided to just offer $150 to $200 to anyone who fills out a complaint instead of hearing the details and trying to improve their customer service.

Flew from Seattle to Puerto Rico, I'd never flown domestic business and I've since learned it's not worth it from all reviews (to put it mildly). It started with the lounge. It was about 6.30 pm when I got there, and I had run out of the house without dinner, assuming I could get some snacks in the lounge and dinner on the plane. The lounge had about 6 crackers scattered in a bowl, a couple of cut up strips of bell pepper, and 4 warm cheese cubes. When I asked the bartender if they had some more crackers, or maybe even some cheese and cold cuts (the empty dishes had little leftover traces of what appeared to be cold cuts), I was told ""what was out there was what was there"". I took my 6 crackers and 4 strips of bell pepper and went to log on to the WiFi. It wouldn't accept the password and when I finally got logged on it was dial-up slow.

My primary complaint is United's Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment services - and this is limited only to their Boeing aircraft. The outbound part of my trip was on an Airbus A320. There are never any connectivity issues, and those planes have a nice library of TV shows and movies to stream over my tablet. The Boeing portion of their fleet, however, is a WiFi disaster. It was so bad on that leg of the trip the flight crew had to do the safety announcement themselves rather than rely on the video that United probably spent millions of dollars producing. If you're able to connect at all on the Boeing planes, the connection is unreliable. United would like you to pay for this service, too. Just don't. It's a rip off. United really needs to end their relationship with Direct TV, and switch their entire fleet over to the system on the Airbus planes. Bring a tablet, download a couple movies on it.

We had to spend 2 days tracking the package, and American Airlines was the replacement airline to get our package from Denver to Santa Fe. SO it was an American Airlines employee who went beyond her duty to take copious notes and actually contacted the tracking office in Santa Fee. All Lost Luggage calls to the tracking office (outsourced as usual and the agents were not able to help us except to say they could only do their best) produced no results. We travelled on Wednesday December 16 and finally got the package on Friday December 18 by which time some of the food stuff had gone off. Then on our return flight on January 8, 2016, our flights were all delayed, starting from Santa Fee and at Denver, it was a nightmare for my mother and I. She needed wheelchair assistance and we had to request for it twice because the gates got changed, like 5 minutes we were dumped at the first gate. At the second gate, we were advised on the Departure screens that the gate was now somewhere else, even further from the original gate. In the end, my mother got fed up and walked to the last gate where we finally got a rep who was very professional and patient. The information on the Departure screen was confusing as both United and Air Canada were shown to be departing at the same gate but with 5 minutes difference. The flight was delayed by 4 hours and instead of getting into Toronto at a reasonable hour of 10.30 pm on Jan 8, we only got home at 3 am!

The Boeing 787-9 we flew in was a new aircraft, the cabin does feel airier, with larger windows, and improved lighting. The cabin crew on this flight was a mix bag of very senior flight attendants who were quite stand off-ish, to younger flight attendants who were very nice, attentive and friendly. United has upped its game in catering for the Business First cabin and it shows. Portions were plentiful, wines good, and choices good. The mid-flight snacks left on the credenza at the forward most section of the cabin and in the mid-Business cabin galley were basic and not great, but not an issue, given the large dinner service. Breakfast was served 90 minutes out of Melbourne. Flight departed on time and arrived 30-35 minutes ahead of schedule. If United can replicate the service and feel of the 787-9 to its other aircraft cabins on long haul flights, then it might have turned a corner. The LAX terminal it operates from is dingy, dirty, and has zero to offer in terms of comfort. It is supposed to be upgraded. Not soon enough.

Flight from London was prompt, seats allocated at check in. On getting to Washington, our flight to Orlando was delayed by 5 hours! Unbelievable. To add insult to the injury, the airline did not even announce the reason nor did they apologise. Rather, the announcement was for volunteers to check in their hand luggage as the plane was completely overbooked. They also requested for volunteers who would offer up their seat since they oversold ticket! The flight back from Orlando was much more horrible, flight was delayed from MCO and this almost impacted on the connecting flight at Washington. No seats were allocated at check in, we had to wait and wait as they kept increasing the duration of the delay of the first leg of my journey. Went to the customer service who didn’t deem it fit to apologise, but said there should still be 40 mins for the connection and she can’t promise there won’t be any further delays. Plane arrived eventually and we now fell on another queue at the boarding gate to get checked in for seat allocation. This delayed the flight much longer. So in all, we had to thrash the first boarding pass given at check in without seats, and got another boarding pass by the boarding gate. On landing at Washington, we had to race out of the aircraft and onto the other gate as there was no plan for the plane to wait and we couldn’t afford to miss the flight as there was no other flight to London by United. And we still had to obtain another boarding pass with seats at the boarding gate. They were unable to sit us together because the attendant said she has been calling our names and we were not there. ‘How would we be there when our first leg was delayed?’ was my question, she works with United Airlines and should have seen that the first aircraft hadn’t arrived. So she almost gave our seats out if not that we were lucky to have reached the boarding gate within the few minutes prior to departure.

I realize that when a flight gets cancelled, the result is usually panic, confusion and frustration. However, being in customer service, I felt that there are other ways of alleviating the stress of their customers. While I was in line for over an hour, I watched one rep point and yell at the customers, one after another. I overhead her tell people that she's heard it all, vacations, family gatherings, job responsibilities. She showed absolutely no empathy for any of the customers with their concerns. She didn't refrain from just yelling at customers, she shared the same love with the employees. ""I only have 2 hands, you'll have to figure it out on your own"". I felt so bad for everyone that experienced the ""help"" of this woman. This woman was the supervisor! It's a wonder why the other employees didn't feel the need to provide good customer service. It was simply, the flight is cancelled, we can get you there on the 2nd. That wasn't an option for us and they didn't provide any other solutions. Except another rep did suggest that we take the Amtrak down to Texas to catch our connecting flight. After hours of sitting in the airport trying to come up with a solution. We thought, how about driving to Denver? So we reluctantly went back to the counter to inquire on flights. Thankfully! We spoke with a male agent who was efficient and polite as possible, he booked our flight with a smile. It was reassuring that he took the time to explain to us the procedure. We left knowing that we had another option. Ironically, while waiting in line for our confirmation, I saw the supervisor walk by with a smile! However, the smile was because she was criticizing someone for duct taping the top of a water bottle. She was shaking her head and name calling. But from afar, one would think she actually liked her job. I am hesitant to ever fly United again. Constant cancellations and delays. According to Supervisor lady, it's always due to weather. When in actuality, it was due to the fact that they had no crew due to the 8 hours wait time. If they weren't short staffed, the weather excuse would not exist.

The customer service line was packed, so we decided to rent a car in order to drive back to Austin, without any help or recommendations from United. The next step was to figure out how to get our baggage, and on 5 different attempts we waited on hold for assistance for two hours each, even with the Gold Member extension. When we finally were able to get an answer, we were told that our baggage would not be delivered to our home because the flight was cancelled due to bad weather, which we know not to be true due to what our pilot said to us (as stated above), and in the fact that flights were taking off around us while we were waiting on the tarmac. Moreover, on our drive to Austin, we did not have a single drop of rain, nor did we see any storms or feel any wind. That being said, all could have been forgiven if the United reps were more patient, United was a little more honest, we had a quicker answer, and United was willing to bend a little when it came to getting us our baggage (which meant an extra hour trip for us to the Austin airport to pick up our luggage).

Of the 4 legs we had, only 1 leg was our family of 5 kept together. Usually my youngest minor child (13) was placed somewhere else on the plane apart from the rest of the family. Having purchased these tickets in February 2015, I find it very hard to believe that the flight was so full at the time of purchase that my family couldn't be kept together. United had my $3000 for 10 months before the flight as I paid at the time of booking. Then, when we arrive in Houston 18 minutes early,we sit on the runway waiting for our gate to be cleared. Then when the gate gets cleared 10 minutes later, they decide to change gates. What should have been a 1 hour layover is now down to a race to go from terminal c to terminal b. We double check the Airport Board to make sure we have the right gate and that the plane is on time. We do, and it says it is. We race to B76 and stand there. And stand there.

On top of all this, I was originally scheduled to go from San Diego to Chicago to Detroit, and the airline changed my flight without my knowledge 2 days before we departed. Because of the airlines delay I was forced to rent a car in Detroit as my arranged transportation couldn't meet us after a 2 hour delay. This cost me an additional $100 as it was a last minute car rental on a holiday.

Two hours later we finally left Birmingham. We noticed a 'Check Pilot' leave the flight deck to sit behind us for the flight to Newark. As we approached Newark the 'Check Pilot' re-entered the flight deck.

The Captain informed us that the aborted landing was due to 'wind'. Yeh right, don't insult your passengers intelligence! On the ground we went to the United desk to get seats on the next flight down to Orlando.

I am American, but live in the UK, so I make frequent trips to the US with my 6 year old daughter. I make an enormous effort not to fly any US carriers when I travel because the inflight experience is on average materially worse than virtually any other airline I know of. United however takes the cake as the worst. The reason I write this review is not because we were stranded overnight somewhere or held up on a tarmac for hours on end. I write this review because of the simple, every day occasions where United flight attendants and staff make flying unpleasant. On one flight, I sat with my sleeping daughter in my lap, call light on, for about 20 mins just to request a cup of water. I finally get the attention of a flight attendant, and she boldly waves me off and never comes to offer assistance. On my last flight, the flight attendant was so impolite at my request for 3 beverages between my daughter and me, I wondered if she was personally bearing the cost of the drinks. Today, I'm connecting through Chicago, and my minor daughter and I are not sitting together. At bag check in, they couldn't reseat me. And at the gate, I swear the steward took pleasure in not being able to do anything to reassign our seats. Instead of offering apologies, he blankly stared at me and repeated - word for word - a useless statement that I'd have to ask for assistance on board. Not only did this leave my 6 year old daughter crying, but after asking 4 people already, I'm to believe that the crew on board are going to do anything? It seems reasonable that United Airlines should be able to ensure children aren't flying alone; but even if they can't, you'd think their staff might not be so put out by their own jobs that they're wholly insensitive to the distress they're causing passengers.

The smaller Embraer jets are nice for the single traveler, as they're designed with a single seat on the right side, so you get both window and aisle. The extra leg room in economy plus seating is worth the extra expense ($30-$45 on the segments I flew). The seats themselves are adequate, but not comfortable. This is an industry wide problem, and not in any way unique to United. The biggest disappointment is the WiFi service. From previous experience, it seems to work very well on their Airbus fleet. The Airbus fleet usually does not have tv screens in the seat backs, so the WiFi service on those planes comes with a library of movies and TV shows to watch. This works very well if you've got a tablet or some other device to watch them on. The Boeing portion of their fleet is another matter entirely. The more recent planes have the TV screens in the seats. There's a basic program that runs during the flight, but if you want to watch anything else, there's a fee. The WiFi service on the Boeing aircraft also seems to be spotty at best. It hasn't worked at all on 3 of the 4 segments I've flown in the last couple months. The Embraer planes fly the short routes. I have yet to come across one of these with WiFi service or a seat back screen. But, given the flights I've been on have only been about 90 minutes, this isn't a big problem.

She told me that she couldn't do anything and when I explained that I have a 3.5 hour layover and that I would have to pay for bags, she didn't have any solutions for me. Rather she argued with me, told me she would talk to a supervisor, put me on hold only to come back and say that it was going to a considerable hold since her supervisor wasn't available and then continued to state she would be happy to cancel my flight altogether and refund me, but I would lose my upgrade that I used. Then she tells me that my husband's status means that we get one bag each checked free. I inquired how does this help me if I'm flying a different airline?

On all our legs United Airlines oversold tickets to ensure every seat was taken. Their loading policy is bizaar. We were always last on (group 5) because we had asked for aisle seats. On any other airline this would probably not matter but because United does not enforce its own carry on luggage rules, the last 50 or so passengers on all the internal legs we flew, had to at the last minute submit to having their carry on luggage removed and sent under plane. This is maybe not a big deal on a short 5 hour flight but our carry on was taken off us as we came down the loading trunk and booked through to Melbourne, two whole days away. Scrabbling to get out medications etc in the unheated trunk in the freezing air of Boston Airport is no fun. (I'm 67) so difficult to get down to get stuff out let alone remember all the things you may need on such a long journey. So shame on United, I'd paid as much as anyone in Economy and some had carry on whilst arbitrarily others did not and for such a long journey.

No video or audio systems or screens with flight routes/flight information. Boarding with ""groups"" system, but non effective and useless, as if you use groups, you should board the bottom passengers first to avoid ""traffic jams"", if you do random groups, it just a waste of time.

I guess rules are rules but I wish United were as stringent in applying their carryon rules. The usual kerfuffle with too many/oversized carryons was experienced on the domestic leg. The FAs handled this situation and the service during the 100% full flight efficiently. Our flight to Sydney was delayed a few hours due to the late arrival of our aircraft but we were kept up to date with the situation by email and gate announcements. Another 100% full flight but boarding via the United group system works well and there was little aisle congestion, apart from the usual oversized carryon bag problem. The FAs were great the whole flight. Nothing seemed to be a problem. Water runs were frequent. The food for both dinner and breakfast was passable although serving/collecting the breakfast 90 mins before arrival on a full flight is rushed. This resulted in the hand out of the landing cards during the descent which is not optimal. especially for families. The IFE worked well with a great selection of movies and TV programs. The toilets were kept in reasonably good condition the whole flight. Seating in economy is tight and becomes a little hard after some time but you get what you pay for.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,October 2015,14th October 2015,0,1,1,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"I applaud United Airlines for attempting to only allow passengers with 2 pieces of carry-ons. However the customer service in regards to only allowing 2 pieces of carry-ons needs to be improved. Flight out of Seattle to Cincinnati via Houston had rude customer service at the boarding gate. If everyone is allowed 2 pieces of luggage to carry on, then the service on the plane also needs to follow and hold the passengers accountable, ie. one piece of luggage on top while the second piece must go underneath the seat. Just because I do not pay the extra to fly first class, does not mean my luggage is less important. I'm a frequent flyer with United (140k in miles), or at least I was until this past weekend, so you would think that making sure each and every customer would be valued by United. Flying back from Cincinnati to Seattle, via D.C. was just atrocious. Arrived in Cincinnati, only to find my flight was delayed 30 mins due to a late inbound flight - but why did it take United 20 mins before I was to board my plane to email me that information? Then another 20 mins later, received an email that the flight was delayed another 30 mins and the gate changed (luckily just the gate over). My connecting flight out of D.C. to Seattle would surely be missed as I would still be in the air while my flight to my final destination would be taking off. Many of us were in similar predicaments. We were speaking with the woman at the boarding gate, and she advised us our flight was out of the original gate (A11). Then when we all showed her our email from United stating our gate was out of A13, so needed to radio down to ask. One person came back on the radio that the flight to D.C. was out of A11, while another person responded with out of A13. When the gate was determined, the woman at the boarding gate now needed to find if the flight to D.C. was first or if the flight to Houston was next as boarding was soon going to happen. Needless to say, my flight was messed up and I ended up staying in Cincinnati for another night. The next day (Oct. 12), I attempted to fly out of Cincinnati to Seattle via Houston. As soon as I arrived at the airport, I yet again received an email from United that my flight was delayed. Surely this wasn't all going to happen again. I was flying out of the same gate, so perhaps? With that flight being late, we were not sure if I would make the connecting flight to Seattle out of Houston. My flight from Cincinnati to Houston was a little over 2 hours and all passengers were able to get a full can of soda. Luckily, passengers were nice and allowed people at the back of the plane to get off in order to maybe make their connection. Rushed to make the connection and the women at the gate were extremely rude. We told one that others were coming from the late flight out of Cincinnati and her response was ""We cannot hold the gate for anyone. You can stay and wait and see if the rest of you party makes it though, but we cannot hold the gate for anyone."". The second woman (taking the boarding tickets) was just as rude. Again the whole you can only have 2 pieces of luggage is fine, but when you are following the rules, having to check your bag at the gate is absurd when United does not actually enforce the ""the second bag must go under the seat."".

We had to go with what was provided. The first flight from Toronto to Los Angeles was in first class on Air Canada. We had a ""pod"" type seat which reclined flat. We were provided with comfortable pillows and a comforter. We had our own individual screen and could watch movies, tv, etc. The food was great and service equally as good. It was everything we had imagined first class would be. We had the same first class treatment from Los Angeles back to Toronto. The polar opposite is true of our United Airlines portion from Los Angeles to Hawaii. The plane is old and first class only means wider seats that recline slightly more than economy with more leg room but extremely uncomfortable to try and sleep in. Besides the food, the only extra we got was a paper thin blanket - no pillows, no screens, no music, nothing. You have to download the app if you want to watch something or listen to music.

As soon as we start landing, the lights start flickering on and off. So we land, they can't leave the A/C on because they have to shut everything off to re-fuel. We sat on there for an hour or more while they re-fueled, and then not only to tell us we may or may not be going through the storm but the lights were flicking because the LAX crew didn't charge the battery enough and that sucked all the energy so they're needing to trouble shoot that, but we'll be fine and off in a jiffy. One guy yelled ""what's going on?"" and the lady flight attendant literally ""shhhh""ed him! They kept going into the cockpit with the pilots and coming out with looks on their faces like ""we're screwed"", but they didn't have the decency to tell us anything. When a man asked about what's going on, the male flight attendant said ""well we had to re-fuel to go around the storm, if we go through it, it'll rip these wings right off. I don't think any of us want that do we."" While we are still sitting on there for who knows how long, the man comes back on and says ""Hey guys we know it's hot but it's just one thing after another, apparently one of the engines isn't working so we're bringing mechanics out to fix it, but it'll be fine.""

United Airlines Economy Plus product is simply the economy class seat but with an additional 3 or so inches of leg room. The economy plus product is only worth buying if you want that extra room but in my opinion I don't believe there's much difference between that and the economy product. I flew economy back and didn't really find it much different. My wife, son and I are all average height and weight so don't require any extra leg room. The main problem is that the seat is far too thin and as such doesn't provide much support. I know this is a design improvement to lower the weight of the aircraft, but it doesn't help your back on those long flights - LHR to IAH is 10 hours or so. I normally fly business class for work for transatlantic flights (SFO and JFK) around four or five times a year on BA's 747-400 or Virgin's A346 or 747-400 and flying the 787-8 is by far the best craft I've been on.

I asked a baggage handler what happened to our luggage, he said it would come off at carousel 9. Carousel 9 was under construction and another baggage personel told us that the bags were going on another flight to West Palm ahead of us. They put a call in to get my luggage and said, go to carousel 8. After another hour and a half later, the bags were still not there. Over a 5 hour span, there was no customer service to address any issues. I finally tracked down my luggage and proceeded to customer service to get an alternative flight.

In short: terrible customer service at the gates. Eventually I was re-routed to Denver after discovering that both the Chicago and the Houston flights (second option) were oversold. The plane to Denver was old and not well kept. On top of that, one of the gate employees wanted to check all of the wheeled carry-on luggage of boarding group 4, even when she was told many of us had short connections.

Upon boarding, we were informed that since my grandson was only 6 years old, he could not sit in the exit row. This information did not appear anywhere on the United Airlines website. He and his mother were changed to two premium seats in the front bulkhead and we were had to keep our two premium seats in the exit row over the engine, and with no window shades. The noise was unberable, and flying into the early morning sun with no window shade was blinding. The FA dealt with this situation by inserting a flight safety procedures card into the window frame and then a folded newspaper which kept falling out. No explanation or apology for the missing window shade was ever given. We asked twice to change seats, as ultimately did the couple sitting in the other two premium seats in the exit row. We finally received two premium seats but in separate parts of the cabin. When I asked the FA for a can of ginger ale, she responded that she would first have to serve the other pasengers and would give me the can only if she had any left over. Finally she brought me an opened can with a flat beverage. No other beverage service was offered, nor any food for purchase on the 3.5 hour flight.

That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm, we waited 5 hours until we could board.

Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane, that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We, after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly.

Then the plane was just delayed leaving its first departure city and we were never told why just that as soon as it gets in we would be on our way. This is just ridiculous.

We were worried about missing our connecting flight the entire time. The second delay hits and people began to be frantic and changed flights. My party and I anxiously wondered if we were going to make our connecting flight or if we needed to rebook online.

Unfortunately, because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers, the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event, this delay caused us (and others, I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United's flights that night and following day were ""oversold"". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home.

I did not receive my bag until 7pm on the 17th. Then, as if this wasn't enough to deal with on our way there, my flights coming home were a disaster as well. We had to return our rental car to Redmond rather than Eugene as that's where our flight was leaving on Sunday. Then, the flight from Redmond to Denver was ""overweight"" due to temperatures in the area. We had to wait until 5 people volunteered to change flights before our flight could leave. I get to Denver only to find out my flight from Denver to SLC was delayed. Not to mention, I already had a 3 hour layover and this delay made it 4+ hours.

The incoming aircraft for my connection ORD-DTW came in a hour late, and by then we were caught in the storm and flights were grounded. We boarded the aircraft twice, and were told to deplane. Eventually the flight was cancelled. A 3:50pm flight to get me from ORD to DTW, I was still in ORD at 930pm. I can't get my checked bag as there is no procedure for that, and it will be on the next flight out to my final destination. We were given discounted hotel coupons, and I was rebooked on a 4:07pm flight the following day. As it was only 4 hours by bus from Chicago to Detroit, I decided to take mega-bus rather than to fly, and thank goodness I did that, because the rebooked flight on the next day was again cancelled due to air control issues! My bag actually arrived at Detroit earlier than I did, and I had to make a trip to the Detroit airport to get it. My woes didn't end. 10 days later, I was going to get back to Singapore from Reagan (DCA-ORD-HKG-SIN). At Reagan, I couldn't check-in, because my entire itinerary was cancelled. I didn't get a reason for the cancellation, and got rebooked on the same itinerary. Alright never mind that I have middle seat for all 20 hours flight. At ORD, I tried to see if there are other seats available at the gate, and the staff was very rude, and unhelpful. ""There are only middle seats available, what do you expect me to do?"". She did not even try to look at my tickets. If she had, she would have seen that I got rebooked on economy plus, and telling me that would have made me feel better about the 15 hours flight. Onboard the plane, I was lucky, and only the aisle seat on the row behind me was occupied, and I was able to have a restful flight on a window seat. Why was the staff at the gate not willing to even look at my ticket? She didn't even look at her screen to check.

At the last minute, as part of the closing doors announcement, the flight attendant announced that entertainment was only available through the United app, which she stated should be downloaded while we were on the ground. I'm fairly certain there was a charge for the entertainment, plus a charge for the necessary wifi connection. The premium economy was okay. It did have extra legroom and more recline (my big issue) than regular economy seats, but the width was barely adequate. And the aisles seem to have gotten narrower since I last flew on a plane.

,United Airlines,Business Class,May 2015,20th June 2015,2,2,1,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"As a loyal United Airlines customer, with Global Service status for years, that following experience has helped me realize United neither values my business nor cares about my experience with their company. On May 29th my direct flight from Dulles to Kuwait was diverted to Istanbul. The pilots timed out and passengers were stranded for over 12 hours in Istanbul- with no Turkish visas nor United staff to re-book and assist with hotels (United has no service in Istanbul, agents were eventually flown in from the Middle East). Indeed diversions are neither planned nor pleasant; however, passengers anticipated United would have had a contingency protocol in place for such events. After being left to fend for ourselves, and spending hours on the phone (international roaming) with customer care, passengers finally reached Kuwait the following day to ultimately learn that the remainder our respective original itinerary were canceled meaning onward travel and return flights to the US had to be re-booked. Shockingly, United did not apologize for the inconvenience and (as of today- eg. 23 days later) has not offered to reimburse visa-on-arrival fees in Turkey nor the international roaming fees passengers encountered while trying on the phone with United’s “Customer Care” team. Furthermore, all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul, zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengers’ account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight. After over a dozen conversations with “Customer Care” leading all the way up to the Senior Manager for Global Services, I am deeply disappointed to say the agreed upon follow-up that was supposed to occur 5 days ago has not. The Senior Manager did have one of his subordinates send an e-mail stating they will be in contact as soon as they reach a conclusion to my request. Wouldn’t it have been nice to receive a message stating “Thank you again for continued business and patience, we value your business and as a customer and respectfully offer our apologies for the inconvenience, reimbursement for the incurred expenses, and credit of the earned miles” ?

Purposely booked a 2 hour connection at EWR given United's timeliness issues as of late. United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate, the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical ‘old United’ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent, much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served – no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger. Much of the US hub counter staff is now outsourced and they are of little help when something goes wrong. The hard product and service is average to slightly below average.

We had also requested upgrades on all flights to Business First and had been approved on our outward and return flights. Then my fears were realised when one hour after checking in online for our flight to SFO I received an email informing me the flight had been cancelled due to the inability to find a crew to fly the plane from SFO to Sydney. After a frantic call to United we were put on the LAX flight which left 2 hours earlier the next day. Of course we lost our upgrade but the customer service rep was good enough to put us in Economy Plus at no charge. Again my fears came back when we were at the airport to be informed that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight being delayed at LAX.

Changes to our departure times were text to our phones while we were already at the airport. Ground crew were dismissive of passengers who asked them any questions and were more interested in personal discussions than getting their job done. The cabin crew were very underwhelming and not accommodating passenger requests, to the point where you were not allowed a second cup of coffee because they had cleaned up and put everything away. The inflight entertainment cut out for our side of the plane and crew were not interested in doing anything about it. After 4 resetting attempts, the screens worked again. This being our second flight in 7 days we were expecting a little more enthusiasm and pride in their work from crew members. Being seated in economy class and not up the front meant that by the time our meals were served they had run out of popular items and we were left without a choice. No apology from crew, we were met with there's none left and this is what you can have. No attempt to salvage the situation at all and since this was a 14 hour flight, it was a long time without food. Of course, we were welcome to purchase an assortment of onboard snacks at very inflated prices. We will not be travelling with United again as this has not been a pleasant experience at all.

This was the second leg of a flight home from Europe. The plane is fairly new and it is one of the most uncomfortable planes that I have ever been on. And that includes the medium and smaller commuter jets. This was a six hour flight. I booked this flight seven months in advance paid extra for the economy plus seating and selected a bulkhead isle seat in row 8 which was behind the ""first class"" section of the plane. However between the ""first class"" section of this plane and my row is what can marginally be called a restroom. It was a six hour flight and this tiny bathroom with a sink barely big enough to wash your hands was in constant use. Each time the bathroom door was swung open and closed those of us in the adjoining rows were assaulted with bathroom smells. After a few hours in the air I noticed that the bathroom smells were more intense and that the floor next to the bathroom door was wet. I spoke to the purser who jumped up and immediately locked the bathroom door and took it out of service. That was a good temporary fix. However I would like to suggest to United that they consider removing that toilet unit from this plane configuration. It really ruins the flight for those stuck in seats close by.

When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection. I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us. I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row. After boarding I realized that the seat that I had originally booked remained open so I simply picked up my stuff and moved to the seat I had originally purchased. This was simply an annoyance and source of confusion rather than a true inconvenience. The flight itself was rather uneventful. We made it to San Francisco made our connection and waited to depart. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Initially we were told that we were waiting for some baggage from a connecting flight they presumably boarded the baggage and we began taxiing. After taxiing for a few minutes the captain came over the speaker and informed us that we had to return to the gate due to a ""water leak"". We then sat in the plane for 2.5 hours while multiple maintenance men stomped on and off the plane trying to locate the source of the leak. After sitting on the (hot) plane for about two hours I had already finished the bottle of water that I had brought on board. When I asked one of the flight attendants if I could get some water she told me that I couldn't have any water because the maintenance man was standing in front of the bottle. Is that the one and only bottle of water that United stocked on this particular flight? I wandered back to my seat and endured the additional thirty minutes of idle waiting. Finally the pilot came back over the speakers and informed us that the ""water leak"" was actually condensation from the coffee maker that the flight attendants failed to wipe up after the last use.

,United Airlines,Premium Economy,,16th May 2015,5,5,0,UnitedStates,10.0,yes,UA 895 4/11/15 UA 99 5/2/15. In my job I average 175k miles of travel a year primarily with UA and their Star Alliance partners. As a 1K I enjoy personalized attention with UA such as automatic rebooking on cancelled flights or missed connections. I fly coach but with my status I frequently get upgrades domestically. Although I'm qualified for 6 global upgades a year that hasn't happened since 2010 when both my wife and SIL received Business Class seats MUC-ORD (prior to the merger with Continental). Unfortunate but could be a sign of the health of the economy that those seats are being purchased. At any rate I am very happy with the service I get from UA and even though I live near ORD I have had very few cancellations or delays of significance flying in or out of Chicago. Prices are competitive and schedules are great making it very easy to co-ordinate travel to Asia or Europe. While I fly Delta and SkyTeam partners occasionally I will fly UA and partners if at all possible. Most recent travel was 747-400 ORD-HKG outbound to Taiwan and MEL-LAX (787-9) and LAX-ORD (757) homebound.,,4,5,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,5,0,e9771ec8-5f59-40b1-b28b-e0edcc3123ba

I was told I couldn't board the plane with my 4 month old infant because of weight restrictions on the plane. 6 people were told they couldn't board the plane including myself and I found out that was based on our fares. I was penalized because I planned ahead and booked my ticket for less money. It doesn't matter that I started my trip hours earlier or that I connected and arrived to the gate on time. Some kind soul did try to volunteer their seat. I overhead the gate crew saying there was a mother and baby who should board next which was superseded by the supervisor who said full fares trump everything. I left my house at 4.45am to catch a flight to connect to Chicago so I could get to my destination in the shortest time possible with a sleeping baby. I am a frequent flier a ""MileagePlus Explorer"" (which I pay for by having a premium credit card) yet here I am - the only person with a child on my plane-prevented from boarding because my $554 fare wasn't enough to get me my reserved seat.

The flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago was on 'mechanical delay'. The 'mechanical delay' was about 90 mins which meant we would not make our next flight out of Chicago to our scheduled event that evening. However when we landed at O'Hare we were unaware that several flights were being held because of our delay. I asked a United staff member at our departing gate about our flight and he said ""it's departing in 3 minutes you will not have time to make the flight"". I went immediately to the Customer Service desk where many of my fellow passengers were congregating. While standing there my party heard our names over the loud speaker to board our flight. One party is physically disabled. Unfortunately we did not make the flight and we missed the first half of the event that evening. United should have contacted the gate to let them know we were on our way should have made arrangements for a cart for the disabled passenger in order to get us there in a timely manner.

,United Airlines,Business Class,,24th April 2015,4,4,0,UnitedKingdom,8.0,yes,I took a trip from London out to Rio De Janeiro and from there to Sydney and back home after another stop over in Rio. My travel started on April 1st on UA 5 from London to Houston. I'm a 1k and upgraded this whole itinerary of about 48000 miles of travel from economy to business using mileage and a cash fee. All upgrades cleared in advance allowing me to select my favourite seating which on United one can do free of charge. I continue to be impressed at the level of courtesy and service in United's premium cabins. The vast majority of cabin staff gave very good attentive and professional service. Good simple food but very enjoyable and well presented. The fish dishes continue to be my personal favourite and were quite delicious. Frequent drink refills no need to ask its just given. Some really outstanding flight attendants. Some customers dislike the business class seating personally I have no problem with it. After a nice meal and plenty of snooze inducing beverages I can literally sleep for hours. The only downside in the whole trip was the closure of Houston Airport as a result of thunderstorms on 16/04/15. This could not be avoided or blamed upon the airline. End result I arrived at Rio on my way back 24 hours late. As a 1k a free phone call to a dedicated phone line got me rebooked on the next days flight keeping the upgrade. But I have to say that I did not envy the legions of poor souls who had to stand in line at Houston Airport that night to receive the same service from customer service. It seemed like hundreds of passengers waiting to see one or two agents working at 2am and it was not a pretty sight! All in all thirteen long haul flights apart from the one delayed by weather all other flights operated either on time or ahead of schedule. There are airlines out there that could not even come close to this level of punctuality. And as always my baggage appeared in the right place at the right time.

Crew on both sectors were accommodating and very pleasant. They made quite an effort to make sure we were well fed and hydrated. I was travelling with two very young children and the crew constantly came up to our row and checked in on us. It made us feel welcomed and relaxed. Great in-flight entertainment with lots of great video on demand.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,14th April 2015,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,I was very disappointed with the service and overall experience I received from this airline I had a flight out of Fort Lauderdale Airport at 7.45 am I had arrived early around 6 am with my 4 month old infant. We boarded the flight on time everything seemed to be going as planned until the flight was delayed due to some electrical in the control panel. We ended up sitting on this flight for a good 2 hours waiting as they kept saying sorry and we will update you more in 5 minutes and then 30 minutes and overall a 2 hour wait time until they said we are sorry but we must all exit the plane and wait in line until we could get booked for another flight. Once booked for a new flight they gave us food vouchers the new flight they booked me on was at 2.55pm it was only 11am so I was expected to wait with an infant for another 3 hours - a long day waiting me with my son. I then received a notification on my phone that the flight they rebooked me on had been delayed 90 minutes which would have meant being stuck in Houston airport where my connecting flight was but that I would have missed by the time the new flight had arrived. I was then put on another flight leaving Fort Lauderdale at 5.15pm and arriving to my destination at 11.18pm. I don't think that this was handled well at all especially since I was carrying a child around and had only me.,,1,2,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,1480db7e-ce00-4fa2-8dcd-e45bc2d2def9

Return was delayed two hours in JAC. Not a problem for me as I had a 5 hour layover scheduled in ORD. Equipment was an A320 as well and the Flight Attendants were pleasant and attentive. I would give higher marks for seat comfort except both ROC-ORD and ORD-ROC segments were on a regional partner using an ERJ-145.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,10th April 2015,5,4,0,UnitedStates,9.0,yes,LAX to MEL on new 787-9 Dreamliner. This is the world's longest 787 route at around 15 hours so I would not even had considered flying United if they were using their old 747 with no IFE. This flight was excellent to the point I was wondering if I was actually flying United. I was in economy plus (which is not premium economy) but the extra legroom for a small surcharge really makes a big difference for such a long flight. The plane was brand new with excellent Panasonic IFE with very clear screen USB and power at every seat Wi-Fi which worked well for the entire trip good food and polite service. This was the best United flight I have ever taken and really feel they have a competitive product on this route (competing with QF A380). The only negative would be that you have to depart from the hideous terminal 7 at LAX. The return flight arrives at TBT to clear customs so think it would be much improved experience if UA international flights could depart from TBT as well.,,4,4,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,5,0,2573befe-8ab2-4cd5-a289-840a8b94d830

I have flown on several different airlines and United served me one of the best meals I have ever had on a plane. The seats were big and comfortable since United has a good seat configuration. United uses a 3-3-3 seat configuration unlike many airlines that uses a 3-4-3 configuration on their Boeing 777's. The flight attendants were nice and helpful.

When I boarded the plane I was not in that seat. Instead I was put in the very last row by the toilet. I had work to do and tried to power through it despite the terrible seat. The seat would not recline and the gentleman in front of me reclined so there was no room. My head was just inches from his reclined seat (I asked and he agreed not to recline all the way back). I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get ""placed"" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn't eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have. I put 1 for staff service as the man in the seat in front of me was hit in the head by the trash bag every time the stewardess went by and she didn't even seem to notice.

The price was OK for few days notice but the in-flight experience was one I would like to forget. In the past I flew overseas with other international airlines from abroad and most treated me and my family very good. With United it was my worst experience flying overseas. Flew from Orlando via Newark to Hong Kong direct. The seats were hard as a rock which made it very hard to sleep. The entertainment system offered all these channels and music that did not work and not available for viewing. The food was terrible and small. It was half the size of a lean cuisine dinner. They charged me $8.00 for a half a can of beer. The attitude of the flight attendants were rude. Returning back to Orlando via Chicago from Hong Kong the flight was an hour and a half late which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Orlando. Got no sympathy from service desk and was stuck in Chicago for an extra 4 hours. I will not fly United ever again.

This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small.

In saying that I am a reasonable person I can understand that our flight was delayed and then cancelled due to mechanical problem. However the rudeness of the ticket agents was a total shock to me and most of the other passengers. Staff did not seem to be equipped to handle helping people re-route their flights and were flustered and unprofessional. It is very difficult for me to express my disappointment in the way the situation was handled. The only apologies we received were from the airport security officers who showed up at gate 29. There were no announcements stating that they (the ticket agents) were going to help us with connecting flights there were no apologies for the inconvenience of having to sleep in the airport no announcement that first class passengers and those with small children would be found hotel rooms and others would be left to their own devices to sleep at the gate. Some water and sodas were provided but not enough for everyone. The ticket agents seemed to be ""put out"" in trying to help us. Isn't that their job? I believe that customer service is a huge part of any business and if you don't have good customer service you have nothing. No food vouchers were offered unless asked for this I found out by asking a fellow passenger where he had received his vouchers.It should have been announced that everyone would receive these after a long night sleeping at the gate. The lack of communication was shameless and again unprofessional! I believe there needs to be some training with the staff at United Airlines Maui to help in dealing with situations such as cancelled flights and exhausted guests.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,25th March 2015,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,I had my first and hopefully last experience with United Airlines this past week. I flew round trip to Orlando with a friend for spring break. Our flight down was delayed three hours because of weather which is admittedly not United's fault however we missed a connection in D.C. and had to fly standby on a later flight that put us at our destination 6 hours after we were scheduled to arrive. The return flight was the real terror though. Our first leg from Orlando to Chicago was fine except for the airline insisting on checking our carry ons through to the final destination. Once in Chicago we were told our flight to Burlington was delayed due to mechanical problems. Eventually we boarded the flight an hour late and took off. We then turned back and circled O'Hare for an hour and a half due to mechanical problems before making an emergency landing and having to get off the plane. They then cancelled that flight after leaving us sitting for two hours while they tried to find another aircraft. At that point I was told there was no way to get me to Burlington before Sunday night (my original flight was Friday morning). I tried to book a flight to a nearby city and was told it was impossible to fly anything other than standby. I was booked on a confirmed seat to Albany for Saturday morning and tried two standby flights Friday night. My friend made it out but I ended up in the airport overnight (I was not offered accommodation). When I went to board my flight Saturday morning they informed me that there had been an error and the flight was overbooked. I was bounced from that flight and booked on one departing in the afternoon. The afternoon flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems and I was unable to get out until Saturday night at 11 pm. After all that they refused to even consider shipping my bag until I had landed in Albany (it had been shipped to Burlington on Friday). It is now Monday and I still have not received my bags. Their customer service is unfriendly unhelpful and refuses to let you speak to someone in charge.

So much for First Class. The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendants…- one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation.

There was no apologies no explanations. We were to depart at 2.25 finally getting off the ground at 6.25. Since I was heading to New England there were no seats and I had to purchase a new ticket on a different airline and could only get to Hartford.

At Denver they shuffled us back and forth between customer service and the boarding gate finally they ended up booking us on a flight to Oahu then Hawaiian Airlines to Kona.

Our return flight was not any better. We arrived at the airport early and was told they had a flight leaving shortly and room on it. With our Kona bound experience we thought it may be a good idea to have more time. Before we boarded they had hydraulic problems and the flight was delayed. We were told our tickets were gone for our originally booked flight. So we waited and for once we made it in time for our connecting flight to Denver until we boarded the plane and the starter went out on the plane they brought it back in fixed it but not before we missed our connecting flight from Denver to Omaha. By now we were wondering if this was normal for United? At Denver again we were shuffled around until they finally found a flight into Omaha for us. Our flight experience with United was well below satisfactory levels. The maintenance issues should be a concern for United. I wonder what their Preventative Maintenance plan looks like if they have one at all and or if they should reconsider their Union as paperwork should not take that long.

They set everyone up with a hotel and a new flight which was excellent.

United employees were few and far between not nearly enough to handle the re-booking of an entire flight. Eventually we were bussed to the Dulles airport for a 4.30 flight to Houston. We were not given any food and United employees were short-tempered and quite helpless. I heard other passengers say they received food vouchers so I couldn't help but wonder why we were not given anything. Maybe it was because we were Travelocity customers rather than direct customers with United or maybe it was because we were very easy and never mouthy or difficult with anyone.

I completely understand this but I feel that more could have been done to get on the plane sooner. I cannot complain about the seats they were comfortable and made of leather (or a similar material). However I was appaled by the lack of entertainment. To a completely literal extent the options consisted of SkyMall United's horrifically boring magazine and the one radio station I could hear which seemed to be an 80's synth station. There was no Wifi no plugs and no TVs not even one. I believe this is a remnant of United. I flew the same route on Continental in 2010 and I received sufficient television programming.

,United Airlines,First Class,,24th February 2015,2,1,0,Japan,1.0,no,Flying UA in F (oxymoron alert) from ORD to NRT. Our 13-hour flight was delayed for three hours after we had boarded because of radio issues. About 30 minutes into the wait they opened up the main door and with temps outside around zero the F cabin quickly became a freezer. I could actually see the breath of the pax in 4A. The cabin itself was tired and dirty with tissues stuck between my seat and the wall. The toilet rubbish bin overflowed about halfway through the flight and was never emptied. The toilet seat was filthy by the end of the flight. WiFi was broken. On the bright side the amenity kit comes with a United-branded ballpoint pen and comb. The food apart from a cold but well-cooked tenderloin steak was largely inedible. The “sausage” that came with the dry crusty omelette was a hard brown puck of mystery meat. Food in ANA Y is far better. There was no wine list because there were only four mediocre wines and some cheap sparkling in 375ml bottles. Service was not rude for the most part but below economy standards on any Asian carrier. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a cup of dishwater coffee. When the woman seated next to me asked what the squid sushi was the FA replied (with a smile to be fair) “Don't ask me I don't make it.”The shoulder harness that F pax are required to wear on takeoff and landing was extremely uncomfortable. When I remarked on this (politely and with a smile) to the FA while putting mine on she patronizingly replied “We can endure anything for a few minutes Mr. Johnson.”Will never ever fly United long-haul again.,,2,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,09a47ad6-ae35-4965-b78a-bf162cf39ce9

This last week we flew from the mid west to the pacific coast using nothing but United. It's natural to have delays from weather related issues but We didn't have any to worry about. What has completely destroyed my desire to fly anywhere again is the complete lack of planning customer service and treatment from all the personnel we had contact with.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,24th February 2015,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"Overall based on a round-trip flight between IAD and SFO I would give United 0 stars. On the outbound leg there was a medical emergency on-board and the United flight crew was totally unprepared to handle the situation. If a medical kit was on-board it wasn't made available to the medical personnel who tried to provide assistance and it took 15 minutes for the Flight attendant to bring a wet towel to help cool the patient down. Our return flight was delayed by almost 5 hours with not even ""we apologize"" for the delay from United. Then our bags were placed on a different flight that didn't arrive until 1 hours after our flight and the bags didn't show up at the airport until 4 hours after we landed. Again no apologies from United. then we got numerous texts from United about the status of our bags. One even claimed the bags arrived at IAD 2 hours before we did.

The crew never addressed anyone by name-I think there were 6 of us and when my aisle mate had trouble finding the chest belt the FA motioned and pointed rather than walking to the seat to assist. The dinner was OK but there was no style in its presentation-or of any of the meal. The crew was present when necessary but had no real interaction with any passengers that I observed. The breakfast was insipid. Again poorly presented eggs lukewarm and the potato patty was soggy and blah as was the some-kind-of sausage patty. All in all it was a simply so far off the ""First Class"" moniker that I arrived feeling nothing but annoyance. The return from Narita was much better. United still lacks any sense of presentation or style but the crew was friendly present and engaged. The meals were both better than those on the inbound more tasty and hot but still far off the mark that is achieved by other airlines not only in First but even in Business. I used miles but had I paid the full freight I would have been furious at what was delivered. I will give UA credit for its hard product.

At check in the staff member rolled her eyes while informing us we were in the wrong line and it went downhill from there. No smiles no greetings no nothing - flight crew were grumpy and detached. When I asked what was on their food menu for purchase another roll of the eyes and was informed it was in the book in front of me. Leaving the plane you could almost hear the flight crew heave a sigh of relief the flight was over and they were rid of us the entire plane load. We were pried into our seats with a shoe horn and never in all my travels have I felt so claustrophobic - the 3 hour leg of the trip was almost unbearable to sit through.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,18th February 2015,4,1,0,Lithuania,3.0,no,"I have no idea why they call travelling United ""flying the friendly skies"". I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren't even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane's systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded ""Oh yes I know I could not understand him either"". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""what would you like"" just appalling ""what do you want"" and throwing it at your table - truly ""the friendly sky""! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little ""sorry"" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not. Since United has obviously different point of view in this regard I will avoid flying them next time.",,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,2,0,64041da5-8beb-49c7-9889-8690021004b3

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,30th January 2015,1,1,0,UnitedStates,2.0,no,In-flight service is long out the window video entertainment is endless infomercials and the last scraps of legroom have vanished into thin air. On a recent full flight from Newark to Los Angeles a new super skinny seating was encountered that climbs to a whole new altitude of pain and suffering. When reputable airlines change to slim seats the airline gets more seats on the plane and passengers get a bit more legroom but at United this would never fly. United now using Continentals short-haul 737-900s on long-haul routes has extra extra seats that don’ t quite fit. To make passable exit row clearance seats behind are compacted to even less than their typical 30-inch seat pitch on this aircraft - less than the 31-inches specified for many other flights - and much less than the 32-inches United advertises when selling economy seats. My seat had only 2-feet clear butt-to-shin with perhaps an additional 4-inch knee-high seatback thickness - probably a 28-inch pinch - or less! When the passenger in front tried repeatedly to recline - there being no extra room it was impossible. The passenger drew a cabin attendant to complain that I would not allow the seat to recline. The attendant seriously explained to me that the passenger had purchased a ticket entitling them to my leg space and may fully recline the seat. Unfazed the attendant told me that if I wanted extra legroom I should have purchased an“Economy-Plus” seat. I asked how much it would cost but there were no free seats - at any price. I explained that I did not need extra legroom just sufficient room - which they were not providing. Not reconciled to the laws of physics the attendant continued insisting that this was all my fault - that I was taking up space that I was not entitled to - and had me turn sideways putting my knees in the aisle so the seat could recline. My shoulder was now in the way of the seat. I could not turn back either and complained that the vending carts would hurt my legs even more than the seatback. Only then did the attendant finally suggest that the other passenger switch seats with their adjacent small child.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,28th January 2015,2,3,0,UnitedStates,7.0,yes,MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.,,5,5,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,4,0,d1473047-2c54-4208-9a90-562872256d05
,United Airlines,Economy Class,,28th January 2015,2,1,0,France,4.0,no,Flight 914 from CDG to MCI with connection at Washington Dulles on Jan 14 in Economy class. The product featured by United is sub-standard. Of course ageing aircraft in the main leg (767) is clean and well maintained and this is the minimum you can expect from one of the largest airlines in the world. Check-in boarding operations baggage everything ok. Seats are standard. VOD is poor with very limited options and not user friendly. The music program was out of order for this flight and films not plenty. Besides on individual screens maps are not detailed and this system is less advanced than 20 years ago (I am not joking) in Asian companies. Also flight information is given exclusively in feet inches miles just if the metric system does not exist in the rest of the world! Regarding meals they are almost edible. We had chicken with some sauce (more sweet than sour) a large salad with a too smallish cup of dressing (good) and a kind of sponge cake pompously christened crumble – wrapped in a cello paper printed European quality but made in Alabama. All in a very small slippy tray complimented with picnic cutlery (100% plastic). And of course passengers have to pay 7.99 $ for one beer. Ridiculous. By the way a sandwich (not bad) was served before landing but do not expect more than water between meal and snack. Fruit juices ice creams and other open bar is a dream out of reach at United. Attitude of cabin crew very professional (attendants have apparently about 20/25 years experience) working efficiently but not cheerful (friendly skies really?) in very bland uniforms which could be copied from Railways of the 70’ Being familiar with Asian and Middle East airlines I find United well below what you may expect from such a large corporation.,,3,3,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,2,0,c7cc87ca-48ae-4f60-81ca-a9b4893ffefc
,United Airlines,Premium Economy,,28th January 2015,3,3,0,UnitedStates,5.0,no,United Premium Economy is a gamble it seems to be directly dependent on the type of aircraft you are flying. On a 777 the seats are nice and spacious the services (seatback entertainment) are premium and you can really feel the extra legroom making the extra charge totally worthwhile. On a 747 the opposite is true I had more room in Economy on an Airbus than I did in Premium Economy on a 747. On the 747 I couldn't even fit my very small backpack under the seat in front of me and what little legroom I had was obstructed by a large piece of plastic. The aisles were noticeably narrower as well which made every beverage service an exercise in getting smacked with a cart (not fun on a 13 hour flight). I did notice there was an extra seat in every row on the 747 which is probably were all that extra room went. Also relying on the old school movie screens meant that even if you were trying to sleep a bright light was shining in your face. On the bright side as always the crew were nice courteous and professional. Long story short though? If you're going to spring for the Economy Plus make sure you're on the right type of plane it makes a big difference.,,2,4,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,2,0,159dcf0d-6f47-49ab-8c0c-0ec99092f459

United booked us to fly into Newark to connect with a flight out of JFK - we got the joy of finding this out when we checked in. On the return flight from Zurich the cabin crew announced that they were short staffed due to management cut- backs. Translation in our case where we were seated near the rear of the plane is that we got one small sandwich six hours into the flight. I would have killed for a glass of water and maybe some food. Then our connecting flight to Raleigh was cancelled due to 'weather' and therefore we were responsible for our own sleeping arrangements. The 'weather' in Raleigh was drizzle. Our bags went American and arrived on time. A complaint to United was not even met with an apology. Instead they offered of a $100 voucher for future travel with them!,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,fe061c8a-6658-4fc4-916d-371e58a62ff0
,United Airlines,Economy Class,,26th January 2015,1,1,0,Uzbekistan,1.0,no,I try to avoid flying United when I can but as I was with Continental I sort of inherited their frequent flyer program. So my review is of a recent flight this last summer but also of their frequent flyer plan which unless you are a Business flyer I would avoid. It's almost impossible to move up to Gold with them. I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United. Needless to say I am now with the FF program of Turkish Airlines and will never fly United again unless it's impossible due to US monopolistic practices. Don't fly United.,,1,2,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,72b01dce-e29d-4fb3-b950-794348fb9530

Not too disappointed since it was still a Dreamliner but the change to the smaller aircraft had the consequence that a baby was moved from the forward business class to the 3 Business rows in the mid-section. A baby on 16 hrs flight - not recommended. Flight departed from LAX 1.5 hr late. Basically waited on board for 1.5 hrs. Everyone had already boarded so we were in this plane for at least 17 hrs. Flight uneventful new Dreamliner is a really great airplane large windows very airy cabin. Seat is good except that not every seat has direct aisle access. Inflight Entertainment great good selection of movies TV shows. Service was attentive (above usual United average) Food was decent. Unfortunately United does not supply their Business customers with Fast passes for Melbourne Airport Immigration so waited almost 1 hr to get through on top of the 1.5 hr delay.

There was no turbulence we were on top of the cloud layer. There was no turbulence during descent as well. I feel the seat belt sign was turned on to avoid further service to passengers.

I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years.

Arrived Tokyo only about 40 minutes late but was told too late to board the 803 flight to Singapore. On arrival I had a good 30 minutes and only hand luggage.

United has the worst food and in-flight entertainment in the industry. The flight attendants want to serve you food immediately after the flight begins so they can chatter in the forward and rear galleys of the airplane. Low fat potato chips and cookies are not a snack they are the lowest cost food options that you can offer your customers.

Checked-in at the dedicated business class desk and was advised that UAL use the ‘Aspire’ lounge at EDI. The lounge was fine with a reasonable selection of food items for a snack breakfast. Flights are not called from the lounge. Boarding appeared to be well managed a number of supplementary security / travel questions were asked by an agent at the gate. Once onboard a welcome drink of champagne juice or water was offered. There is a 2-2 flatbed seat configuration in Business Class. The seat was comfortable with plenty of space and easy-to-use chair and In Flight Entertainment controls. The plane Departed on time at 09.05. On board service began roughly 45 minutes after departure. The main meal was lunch followed by a snack prior to arrival at EWR. In my opinion this is where UAL need to put more thought into what is offered. In view of the time of day prior to 10.00 a full breakfast or brunch rather than a lunch might have been a better catering option? The service from flight attendants was efficient although some of them appeared to be a bit tired looking. Small touches such as addressing passengers by name were absent on this flight. This was done on the inbound UA36 EWR-EDI 8 Jan 15 in comparison. The flight arrived at EWR around 35minutes ahead of schedule this was partly due to an on board medical emergency situation.

It was 10am and they claimed they had no way to get us home that day unless we spent $80 to take a shuttle to another airport and then took two more flights from there. They then charged us three times for our bags. Overall (not including the two extra bag charges) this cost us an additional $180 and they refused to pay for a cent. I will never fly this airline again.

The flight from Cancun was delayed 1.5 hrs leaving us under 40 minutes to go through customs re-check our bags and get to a different gate in another terminal. We did not make our connecting flight. Along the way there were no helpful attendants and no actions taken to give us even a fighting chance to get to our gate. They attendants on the plane had no information about gates connecting flights or any other helpful info. We missed our connecting flight to New York. We kept getting sporadic ever- changing alert texts from United. Sometimes the flight was delayed by 2 hours and then reverted back to half an hour. We did not received a comped hotel and had to spend additional money staying the night at Houston. We were re-booked onto a flight the next day at 10.21 am. We arrived at the airport approximately two hours before the flight. Tthe flight was delayed 54 minutes and would now be departing at 11.15am. Shortly after we were told that the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours departing at 12.45pm. Having been up and at the airport since early morning we were famished. We decided to use the restrooms and grab a quick bite to eat as we had a 4-5 hour flight ahead of us. In that extremely brief time the flight time was reverted to 11 am. We received the notification at 10.30. After the flight was delayed 2.5 hours we made the rational decision to eat something in the meanwhile. Does United expect that it's customers not get up from their seats to relieve themselves get a drink of water or a quick bite to eat after having waited at the airport for so long? We missed our connecting flight again due to incompetence and poor customer service. We immediately went to an agent where we again received attitude and condescending lectures.

Soup was served in a teacup sized bowl main was ok desert was ok too if you like ice cream as that is the only option.

Slimline seats with a big screen in front of you a large choice of new movies games and shows. Legroom again very good the 31in. at United appear to be bigger inches than those on other airlines.

Then our flight was over an hour late because of delays loading luggage. We missed our connecting flight and we had to wait in Anchorage with our three month old son for 8 hours. We didn't get a meal voucher or anything. The staff that worked for United told us that we weren't entitled and it was too bad. They gave everyone free movie on the plane but my husbands didn't work.

At LHR the staff were very helpful in sorting out our ESTA cock-up (kids' passports had been changed since applying for ESTA). That is the only positive about United. The seats are uncomfortable and cramped the choice of in-flight entertainment poor (even if you could see it on the minuscule seat-back screen) or for the 2 hour flights pay-TV and the food absolutely disgusting. No snacks offered (I guess they are worried people will fill up on these having tasted the food) although available to purchase and no complimentary alcohol. Attendants fairly average and could certainly do with a better corporate uniform on trip out. On way back distinctly poor. Most worrying was the man who was on our plane and about 20 mins before take- off realized he was on the wrong flight only when somebody else came to sit in his seat. How is that allowed to happen on United from Washington? From a security point of view it is unbelievable and I wonder how the poor bloke fared trying to find the correct flight.

Seat Comfort: average for domestic seat comfort with the disadvantage that there is no pillow blanket or other accessories offered. Food and Beverages: Here the situation started bothering me. The only available food was for sale! The only beverages were water juice and such. Everything else was for sale. Inflight Entertainment: The only provided entertainment was also for sale even to listen to music you had to pay. Staff Service: I guess this varies but it was pretty poor. Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight. After traveling to Europe and South America for the last two years in different airlines I think this is a very poor service for such a high price.

Food was limited to snacks but that was to be expected (why US airlines do not have lounges with food selections akin to those of international airlines is beyond me). But two unexpected plusses were the presence of showers (which I did not use) and free alcoholic beverages (albeit of limited varieties).

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,22nd December 2014,1,3,0,UnitedStates,8.0,yes,"Sat in 24D on an Airbus 320 from Seattle to Newark. This is a standard aisle seat located on the right side of the aircraft just a few rows behind the over-wing exit rows. It is one of what I call the ""back-of-the-bus"" seats featuring the new Slimline Recaro seating. In light of the trend by most of the domestic air carriers to squeeze as many seats/rows as possible into their airplanes the best thing I can say about this seat is that it was adequate in terms of breadth leg space and comfort. If you are 5' 10"" or less in height or a somewhat taller person with short legs you will be able to sit in this seat and still have a couple of inches between your knees and the back of the seat in front of you. In other words you don't have to sit upright and uptight and feel as though you cannot move or are frozen in place. The lumbar support of the seat back is neither better nor worse than any other typical economy/coach-class seat on United Airlines. I do wish that the seat cushion itself was more supportive - it felt soft and thin - perhaps because the density of the foam filler or stuffing material used is lacking. On a long flight this seat may become uncomfortable and cause you to squirm a bit or want to get up and move around. Seat recline has been reduced and I was only able to move/tilt the seat back about two inches. Fortunately for me the middle seat on this flight was empty and that made my specific seat feel less confining and more bearable as I could spread out a bit (likewise for my seatmate in the adjoining window seat of this row). The staff appeared competent and the service itself was decent. The plane appeared relatively clean and well- maintained. Lamentably there was no in-flight entertainment system whatsoever which seems to be the trend on the smaller Airbus and Boeing aircraft operated by United. To reiterate my earlier comment this seat was adequate and tolerable given the trend by the airlines of reducing seat pitch on their aircraft. Stated simply it represents the new standard in air travel for the average passenger traveling on a budget.",,3,4,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,4,0,6efccbb3-0c1d-4eec-8525-fe6bc1357a70

The worst part is that the personnel seemed tired of being caught between management decisions that have reduced the quality of service to nothing more than a poor commodity and travelers that resent the carrier.",,2,2,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,0cdbfd2b-a47f-43d1-ac3e-b0589b1b9e37
,United Airlines,First Class,,18th December 2014,1,2,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"Flew IAH-HNL-IAH in First Class on November 20- 24. I have flown this route several times in the last 15 years and since United took over the flying experience has taken a serious nose dive. Since this route is taken by people mostly cashing in frequent flyer miles and there are not that many ""paying"" passengers United has decided that we do not deserve the amenities that are available on other routes. The first class cabin seats are very uncomfortable and are nowhere near the first class seats of other carriers for long haul flights. The plane had no inflight entertainment and there was not any power ports for charging personal devices - and this was not just first class but the entire plane. If there was another direct flight to Hawaii from Houston on another carrier I would take it. Flying to Hawaii on Continental was a fairly good experience the food was good and the seats were comfortable even though they did not fully recline.",,1,4,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,c9b8c434-a93e-477b-b08a-40e4eb2e3768

I was traveling to Guatemala City from Dallas making a connection in Houston. We boarded the plane then shortly after got off due to a maintenance issue. Not once were we asked if we had a connection flight or explained to how they would help us get to our destination nor did they give us any updates. I had to ask what to do. I was supposed to be at my destination at noon. I arrived at 10.30pm. Similar incident on my return - took me all day.

The only issue with the dreamliner (787) is the lack of proper window blinds. On the flight Shanghai-Los Angeles I was near the window facing south meaning that I always had the sun in front of me.

The seats are the old Continental flat-bed seats which are angled ever-so-slightly towards the window. Although it's a flat bed the bed is very narrow and at my 190cm I could not stretch out. Felt like sleeping in a coffin! Also when you have to go to the bathroom it's quite the operation to step over your neighbour without waking them up.

Flight 1: GIG check-in staff very nice. Lounge (GOL low cost) very poor and packed. Flat seat 9D very nice. This part of Business class is much more noisy because close to engines. To be avoided at all costs. FA's very pleasant and smiling. Decent food. Poor drinks. Smooth 9 hours flight with constant info form flight deck. Surprising wide choice of IFE On time. Had to go through immigration and security in IAH. Lounge staff very pleasant. Food awful. Alcoholic beverages charged (>US1000 a glass). Fantastic shower and shower staff. Flight 2: Seat 1L. The best seat on board much more space 3 windows Silent. Same aircraft by coincidence. FA rather unpleasant and rude. Take it or leave it. Very bad food. Horrible Champagne. A nice white Bourgogne that ended after 30 min. At 11.50am lunch was completed then believe it or not no food during the next 12 hours!

,United Airlines,Premium Economy,,4th December 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,6.0,no,I may be done with United. Have had gold or platinum status for years but am getting increasingly concerned with linking flying to shopping and spending more money. As much as I hate to give up the three bags the comfortable lounges in airports it is becoming too stressful to keep up. I have almost lost respect for the airlines. Shop till you drop seems to be the key here. We are losing miles we have to spend more shop more buy the credit card.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,4th December 2014,1,3,0,UnitedStates,6.0,no,First off let me preface that I am not a frequent flyer so I tend to give airlines the benefit of the doubt if there is ever any problems. In the past 6 months I have flown two round trips with United one was non-stop and the other had 1 connecting flight. Every single one of those flights were delayed by an average of 2 hours. I would understand if there were weather conditions that cannot be foreseen but all the delays happened in Florida and California both of which had great weather. I even signed up for text alerts to get notified of these things and my alerts either came in an hour before the scheduled departure flights or never came I'm at all. That defeats the purpose of the alerts because you should to be at the airport about 2 hours prior to your flight. When I went to ask the staff at the counter at the airport they all seemed clueless and was not able to help me alleviate my concerns at all. Some were even downright rude and short with me. These inconveniences have almost cost me to be stranded at the airport because those my friends and family were not able to pick me up. I am more than furious at the less than poor customer service that United has to offer. I've spent hundreds probably even thousand of dollars to travel with this airline but I've failed to receive the proper service and professionalism from their staff and company overall. It is sad to say but I will not be flying with United Airlines anytime again soon. I would rather pay a bit more for other airlines just to ensure that I will receive the kind of service that I should be receiving as a customer.,,2,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,2,0,552a028c-afd0-46d5-9216-553a79abe769

It was my first time flying Business class as I normally fly Economy or Premium Economy and as such I was looking forward to it. Overall I was very disappointed: food was average toilets were dirty and did not appear to have been cleaned difficult to get the staff's attention staff not willing to smile even when I was smiling at them meal service was disjointed (on one flight they offered a bread roll and some wine after I had finished my main course on the other flight they took my glass away for a refill and didn't bring it back) and the staff kept on bumping me when they walked past. The only good thing was the beds lie flat but otherwise I was very disappointed and I found that the Premium Economy on other airlines is much better (such as Qantas Virgin or Singapore).

When I first came to the airport I saw the flight would be delayed for 5-10 minutes. The flight time was originally 12.05 am but because of the delay it was supposed to depart at 12.15 am. So it was ok. But then after I board the flight does not leave until 12.40 am because they were waiting for passengers to board so obviously some passengers were late. In Air the flight crew was nice but they seemed like old United flight attendants to me. So they seemed a little cold to me. But the flight was good and I slept for 4 hours out of the 8 hours. I was glad the flight attendants gave my son the executive dining with out him asking. But the flight entertainment was ok. So it was an ok flight and it was better than the average United flight.,,4,4,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,4,0,639afd4d-034a-4c68-9e8a-b40ebdb419bb

,United Airlines,First Class,,1st December 2014,1,2,0,Canada,2.0,no,"Don't pay extra for business on United. We just flew United from Vancouver to Oahu via San Francisco and are now on our way back. We paid the extra for business class - the ""breakfast"" on our first flight consisted of a scone. On a 6 am flight you don't exactly have a chance to grab a bite before departure. There was WiFi on this flight and it had personal TVs which are better than nothing but not quite up to what we are used to with Air Canada. We barely made our connection in SFO - our bags were not so lucky. The next flight had personal TVs but no Wifi. The latter would have been really useful on the long flight. At least we finally got breakfast. The flight crew was inattentive on both flights. On the way home the long haul flight back to the mainland did not have personal TVs or overhead screens but it had WiFi! That was great for as long as my laptop battery lasted but alas the old seats had no power outlets or USBs so my joy was short-lived. Both of our seats were not capable of staying in the upright position and would slowly recline. We chose United over Air Canada as we didn't want an overnight flight home. Next time we will go direct with WestJet and cram into their tiny seats in exchange for a direct flight that operates at a convenient time. We wish Air Canada would put back their daytime flight home. In summary - service and amenities on United are inconsistent even in United First. Even when they are at the top of their game it's all pretty marginal.",,3,2,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,2,0,dff16c0b-953b-4010-9118-f7486cb468e6

The attendants at the gates will not help us even though there is no line. This is deplorable. SFO is a United hub.

All mainline jets were in Econ Plus or Emergency Row so leg-room was great. Most flights on-time and service was good. It's so hit and miss with UA as one flight had great service and the next mainline flight was bitter flight attendants. Regional flights were good - flight attendants had personality and very friendly service. Entertainment on some flights and others nothing but a shared screen with a movie released a year ago. Other than the IAH-ORD flight all on-time. Fare was decent so overall a good trip.

Though UA ground staff at check in counter were quite helpful they couldn't do anything except asking me to go to boarding gate and wait the problem to be resolved there. I was told UA does overbooking in all classes. I was looking forward to this flight enroute in First Class as I was connecting to BKK hence I wanted to relax. Alas I wasn't able to relax as I had to ask UA team for every 10 minutes for an update. Finally after a long argument with the gate staff I was given a a First Class seat by an arrogant lady who made one feel that she did me a great favor although it was within my right.

The entertainment system offered very little choice was shown on tiny screens and from what I could see quite a few screens including mine were broken or were only showing half a picture. Again the crew were robotic with no personality at all and although efficient they seemed totally disinterested.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,12th November 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,I have been flying United for the past 6 years from MAN to EWR and to my dismay it is a total and utter shambles. Within those 6 years I have flown as a solo passenger whilst being pregnant and then with an infant and later with a toddler. I would not recommend them to a single traveler let alone a pregnant one. The only reason we continued to use this airline was due to the fact that EWR has the most quickest and convenient route home. Apart from that there is nothing that is appealing about the airline. The seats are not the slightest bit comfortable however you are able to slightly move them back to a tilt. I can disregard the seating as almost all airlines are the same but the cabin crew were obnoxious rude and definitely did not seem to enjoy their job. Asking for juice was definitely a chore for them.

,United Airlines,Premium Economy,,6th November 2014,2,1,0,India,2.0,no,My flight was 2 hours late from MSP to EWR and so I was going to miss my connecting Etihad flight to Mumbai. However the ground staff at MSP were very helpful and booked me on a direct United EWR to BOM flight that was scheduled just an hour later than my original flight. However my good experience stopped there. The premium economy seats were terrible. Not enough leg space and the head support wings were not adjustable vertically which meant anyone shorter than 5 feet 8 inches could not use them. Second there was no complementary alcohol (not even a glass of red wine) available on the 14 hour flight. I was mentally prepared for their standards but was still let down. On top of which I could pay only by credit card for a drink. Considering I was a Indian tourist the likelihood of me doing this was very low. The food was terrible and both the veg/non veg meals were almost inedible. The air hostesses were not friendly and avoided eye contact. They seemed very put upon by their job.

I have never seen such a pathetic excuse for a lounge the snacks were questionable and the whole lounge is out dated and appears dirty. Cabin staff were clearly annoyed by the delay imagine I paid for this my seat area was sticky and dirty flight attendant was un co-operative when I asked her to clean it. I was never once addressed by my name the crew clearly thought that they were doing me a favour by even being on the flight. Food was worse than I've ever seen even for a United flight. Fortunately I took my own food we were told Restroom was reserved for crew so the 2 restrooms for business class had to serve first class. All food was prepared by bare hands and galley person eat food as she prepared it also sneezed and even scratched her head whilst preparing food. Other airlines offer pre packed nuts etc. considering the choice of other airlines that fly from the US to UAE United is way behind. Looking at Emirates lounge in Dubai or BA lounge in London puts United at the back of the line. I did arrive in Dubai and so did my luggage but the trip was far from first class and worse still some of the original crew were on my return flight and still equally annoyed by having to perform their duties. Cabin staff are obviously disgruntled and it shows I wonder what happened to the old continental crews because before the merger continental really wasn't that bad as airlines go. Today's first class on United is not even as good as the old business first on continental. Worse still one of our group who had suffered 15 hours from Dubai to IAD was down graded from IAD to IAH because of over booking. I've learnt my lesson never again with United.,,2,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,531d9e53-0352-405c-9254-c39a01de44f8

The disappointment started with entry to the lounge on both occasions where no substantial food was offered. Carrots by the truck load and processed cheese on the tiniest crackers did not appeal so we had no option but to head back out to a food retailer for a sandwich at further expense (having spent £6000 on tickets already for this allegedly upgraded service). Liquid refreshments are limited with my husband being charged for a third drink when I had not even had one! It would appear that United Airlines Cabin Crew Bar Staff and Club reception staff attend regular classes in being curt disinterested or just plain rude! Thankfully waiting staff etc do not and are very pleasant. Regarding the plane itself on both occasions these were very obviously old and incredibly uncomfortable. Sitting in row 2 on both flights subjected we were subjected to cabin crew slamming doors continuously chatting very loudly or witness several members chomping on food whilst preparing the passengers meagre offerings. Please United Airlines take note of all these negative reviews you are offering a low budget service at a Premium price.

The servers were friendly and helpful although after the meal was served about an hour in you had to make a request for a beverage over the next 5 hours as opposed to any regular beverage service. I rarely fly first class so maybe they expect you to ask for something as opposed to bringing beverages out regularly?

I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,31st October 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,Since the late 80's I have been flying UA for business and pleasure and it has been a roller coaster ride. Having switched to another carrier for the last couple of years due to truly awful reliability and missing customer meetings I thought I would give UA another chance on a trip from Denver to Paris. How hard could it be? Get on the DEN-ORD flight allowing 2.5 hours in ORD to make the transfer to the ORD-CDG flight. The trip occurred 10 days after the control center fire and calls to UA customer service a couple of days prior to our trip confirmed things were working well again in ORD. The origin flight in DEN was the continuation of a SEA-DEN leg and that plane arrived right on time. The departure for ORD showed on time so we went to the gate to find another on time message on the board. Boarding time came and went with a last minute 15 minute delay. No problem I thought we had plenty of time in ORD. Soon another delay showed up on the gate monitor now we were 30 minutes late should I be worried? How much worse could it get and where was the Seattle aircraft that had made it to Denver on time? Soon another delay with the bottom line of just over an hour. Finally we boarded and pushed back and sat and sat and sat for another 15 minutes when a mechanical problem was announced. At this point it was clear we would miss the Paris connection and we went to the long lines at Customer Service to see what we could do. UA moved us to the later Lufthansa Frankfurt non-stop with CDG connection and said they would transfer our bags. (Of course no bags the next morning in CDG and UA blamed it on Lufthansa). Bags showed up 3 days later and we found out that UA sent them to ORD on a later flight. All this is very sad as the customer service people are trying hard to make their system work but are hamstrung by continued incompetent management. Once again we are riding the competition who are not perfect but much better than UA.,,2,4,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,18f443cb-9f72-4baa-9896-57618d27e80e

To my astonishment I was about to make an 8-hour transcontinental flight on an ancient Boeing 737-200 whose regular use in domestic routes was phased out in 2008. United wouldn't be United without some kind of delay so there was a 30-minute hold. The flight was relatively smooth.

When I asked for a glass of water while plane was still boarding an extremely rude flight attendant asked me: ""Do you really want it now?"". Again United definition of a Business class does not include providing enough food for everyone.

,United Airlines,First Class,,13th October 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,Oct 7 SF to Kona First Class. At the prices they charge even in this age of low expectations I was shocked at the experience of this trip. To begin with the aircraft used a 737 is just inappropriate for a five hour trip. The legroom was ridiculous for any class of service but unbelievable for a premium ticket. When the gentleman in front of me reclined his seat I had absolutely no space left. In coach one has come to expect this but not at these prices. I was one of two people judging from the upgrade list posted who paid full fare and that resulted in a full cabin. The flight attendants tried hard but United gave them nothing to work with. The breakfast served was small and awful there was only non fat milk for coffee and the food was inedible. The flight was timed to leave at 9.44 to avoid serving a more expensive lunch by one minute. The cost cutting is unbelievable the experience absolutely horrific to be avoided at any cost. Back to Hawaiian Airlines I go - the extra stop required is well worth it.,,1,3,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,7ac80e55-5816-41b6-9bf9-61b5886bb5e3

,United Airlines,Premium Economy,,13th October 2014,1,1,0,Sweden,2.0,no,Flew Oct 6th LAS-ORD on an ancient B-757. Like a trip back in history albeit not a good one! No idea why United still flies these ancient planes with pretty much original interior from the 80's. Chose Premium economy as it was 35h flight 79$ for this was just a scam pretty much. Got 5 extra inches leg room and that's it. Would have been nice with at least a free sandwich or whatever. Guess US carriers are still years behind European and Asian one's. Why not just call it what it is extra leg room seats? Spent 3h playing on the phone as United appears to address their customers as idiots as this was a morning flight with mostly business passengers yet still playing a cartoon movie on the overhead monitors. Talk about missing your target. Several items on the menu also ran out was sitting on row 2 so guess they just dont care to stock up on items guess what United that's another way to miss income from your passengers.

As soon as I checked in I was told they had overbooked and asked us to fly to London first. I explained that we had a connection flight to Rochester and we were attending my nephews wedding so couldn't have any delays. We were then told there was no seats on the Rochester flight. After a lot of arguing they got us on the 1st flight to Newark and then found us flights on the Rochester flight but the 4 of us would not be seated together. I had 2 children with us and was not happy but just pleased to get the flights. Coming home we were delayed 3 times from Rochester. Our connection flight from Newark was boarding at 6.30pm we got off our flight from Rochester at 7.05pm and had to run for 10 minutes to catch the flight my daughter has asthma and struggled however we just made the flight.

They were completely uninterested in any one of the passengers and we we're treated as a huge inconvenience. The food was horrendous. When we flew from New York to Vegas things got even worse - we had a 5-hour flight with no entertainment. If we wanted something to eat or drink they wanted paying for it and the prices were ridiculous - the free tea coffee or juice were disgusting so we stayed away from them for the entire flight. Again the crew were abysmal to say the least. We will never fly with United again.

,United Airlines,Premium Economy,,13th October 2014,4,4,0,Canada,3.0,no,Travelled on a connecting flight from Toronto to Houston TX en route to Rio de Janeiro. Flight from Toronto was inexplicably delayed. Upon arrival in Houston taxied to the gate only to find another plane at the assigned gate. Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline. Enhanced public relations by United staff would also go a long way in appeasing disgruntled passengers. That being said the regional jet from Toronto to Houston was new and very roomy. The premium economy seats on the B777 was also comfortable.,,5,2,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,3,0,cf7483c5-86b3-4706-9387-194267b4999f
,United Airlines,Economy Class,,8th October 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,Friday 26 Sep 2014 my wife and I went to BTV for what we thought were two legs of a flight on United Airlines that would get us into SFO at 12.40 PT. We actually arrived at approximately 02.30 PT on Saturday about 14 hours late. Part of the delay was caused by someone starting a fire in the FAA control tower at ORD. I have no complaints with United about that. My complaint with United is its total lack of communication on that Friday and on the return the following Friday. On the first leg from BTV to ORD United kept telling us we had to wait an hour. We could not leave we had to sit there with no information hour by hour from 07.00 to 16.00. The only thing we were told was our connections would be okay because they could not fly either. United even put us on the plane and pulled away from the gate at about 12.30. Then they brought us back to the gate and had us deplane and wait some more. Finally we left at about 16.00 and got to ORD expecting to get on the flight to SFO we were told was waiting. Imagine our surprise and anger to find the flight had left hours before. We were told we would have to stay the night in Chicago at our expense and leave in the morning! When I asked what about getting on the SFO flight the customer service person said it was fully booked and had a wait list. When I pushed the agent did put us on the wait list. One piece of luck we got on the plane. It was late enough that other people did not show. We spent the week in SFO and went to the airport in plenty of time. We had checked in for the return flight when we checked in for the outbound flight online. We went to the kiosk to check-in and there was no reservation. The agent at SFO was able to get us on the plane somehow so we relaxed again almost as much as we were when we went to the airport. Then she hit us with an unwarranted baggage charge. It was unwarranted because we used a United MileagePlus card for the flight. Despite realizing we had not been charged for the bags on the way out to SFO she would not believe us they should not be charged for. When we got to ORD we discovered our flight to BTV was not our originally scheduled 3 hour layover but an 8 hour layover. Again there was no communication from the SFO agent to us about changing our second leg it was just done. After a lot of talking we got onto our originally scheduled flight and got home on schedule.,,2,2,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,0649e9f4-1bbc-470e-b41b-0e2aedd0861d
,United Airlines,Economy Class,,8th October 2014,3,4,0,Canada,9.0,yes,We had a great experience with United Airlines on our return flight from Ottawa (Canada) to Phoenix connecting through Chicago O'Hare. Our flight to Phoenix was smooth and on time. The only thing missing was inflight entertainment. Our return flight was complicated by the fact that a disgruntled employee set a fire to a centre governing the flights through both Chicago airports on the Friday before our Sunday departure. We called the United 1-800 number and got through to an agent quite quickly. She was extremely helpful and could not find us an alternate flight with United so arranged for us to take a flight from Phoenix to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to Ottawa with US airways. We departed and arrived at a very similar flight to our original flight with United. This was the best service that I have ever received in a difficult situation like this. We had a very tight connection on the way back and our baggage arrived on the flight with us.

In Tucson the ticket agents argued and snapped at each other in front of the customers. The Tucson-LAX portion was fine the flight attendant was very professional and as I was traveling with a handicapped companion she was very helpful. The flight from LAX to Kona Hawaii however was awful. The flight attendants were rude short tempered and often ignored passengers questions. This was a five and a half hour flight to not even provide peanuts as a snack is ridiculous considering the cost of the food available for purchase. I will say the ground crew in Tucson LAX and Kona were fantastic and really went out of their way to help out. My issue is that the ground crew doesn't work for United and I didn't buy my ticket from them.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,5th October 2014,1,1,0,NewZealand,1.0,no,On a recent trip we flew 3 times with United. The first flight was on 9 September and we flew from Vancouver to Denver with a stopover en route to Albuquerque. These seats were all booked by a travel agent and confirmed 5 months prior to travel. On the first flight my husband and I were seated separately - I was seated behind my husband. We were given water and/or soft drink during the flight. The attendants were very brisk and almost rude in the 'service' they offered. But the flight did leave and arrive on time. The connecting flight however was not such a straight forward experience. When we went to the check-in we were informed by the staff that the flight had been over booked and that we at that stage were the over booked people. They did not apologise in fact they treated us very rudely. They spent the next hour and a half offering 2 passengers other flights hotel accommodation and $500 flight vouchers each in an effort to allow us to board the flight. Eventually and approximately 3 mins before the flight doors were to close after boarding and after I stood at the counter for around 10 mins they informed me that we could board. Again we were seated separately with my husband at the back of the plane and me sitting at the front. Never any apology. Our third flight was on the 13 September and we flew from Albuquerque to LAX in readiness for our flight back to Auckland NZ. The staff at the airport were again rude. Our flight left more or less on time and the flight staff were great bright and friendly. They actually appeared to be enjoying their job and treated the passengers with friendliness and courtesy.

The Agent was amazing and put me on another airline that would get me home to my family. Forever grateful! Once on the plane to Chicago the 1st class flight attendant was very attentive and extremely caring. When I asked if there were any snacks she said that the previous flight had depleted the stock. When I informed her about my birthday flights and the problems I was having she went all out. She offered me her own personal snack out of her purse with a smile. Selfless and sincere. She was a blessing to my day. As I left she handed me a ""care package"" of treats she was able to scrounge up on the plane for and offered me a happy birthday wish.

The programme can offer outstanding benefits if your travel needs match their network. I recently flew LHR to EZE via IAH. And this was fairly typical of my travels in recent years. I booked an itinerary in economy class and upgraded using miles and a cash fee. All flights were upgraded to business first well in advance of my departure. All flights offer lie flat seating. Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer.

Told by flight attendant that this is due to one crew member coming late to the flight causing the delay. Now I have 30 min to get to flight which will not happen and have to stay night in Houston. United has reserved flight at 07.30 next morning. Problem: Parking has been prepaid on my vehicle only until my arrival time. My luggage is already in Phoenix as it left on earlier flight. No reservations in Houston for stay. No meal arrangements. I will refuse to travel with United in the future. Just a note. United has offered meal vouchers and hotel.,,2,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,3,0,ec7686de-be14-4c69-9f2f-939f1e536de3

The seats for outward journey LHR-Washington was 19G and E which was fine but on return journey our seats were 27 G and H These seats are just like any normal cheap economy seats. As usual the leg room felt the same as cheap economy seat the space between two aisle seats was the same. Trolley kept hitting passengers. The food was of poor quality on both legs. The seat were sold by their agent claiming that the Economy Plus class is just as good as Premium class of other airlines and few hundred pounds cheaper.,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,cbf068b5-fe10-43b5-ba37-a62fca9248aa

They can put me on US Aiways but I have to go to Reagan National airport. I have no way of getting there so they put me on a shuttle. My checked luggage (which I had checked in at United) ends up in Norfolk VA. I fly on the 4 pm flight from Reagan airport on US Airways to Buffalo NY and get home at 5 pm. I will never fly United again. I have used them for over five years for my flights to D.C. where my son and grandchildren live. The plane was dirty and noisy.

Never have I flown another airline with this kind of awful service small airplanes and old smelly seats pretty uncomfortable for business class. Rude attendants was quite bossy boarding is odd you have a business boarding pass and start wondering how many people fit in that section of the plane before they allow you to board.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,19th September 2014,1,1,0,Canada,3.0,no,LAS-ORD-AMS. I try to like United but the delays have become too much. Initially booked LAS-IAD and onward SN connection to BRU. Aircraft change on LAS-IAD led to being bumped onto LAS-ORD-IAD-BRU. Unworkable as ORD layover was only 50 minutes and my parents on separate ticket weren't bumped. Ultimately accepted change to LAS-ORD-AMS on UA metal but with upgrade to E+ for trouble which was appreciated. Tight layover of 75 minutes in ORD. Morning LAS-ORD flight delayed 60 minutes despite good weather across the country. UA agent offered next day's flight if we missed our connection I had to push hard and literally read out each flight number on alternative LH LX and UA flights. Agent was in the end helpful in taking my instructions protecting us on LH flight from ORD-FRA-AMS if flight was missed. Stress remained high; paid for Wifi on ORD to monitor situation. Arrival gate repeatedly changed adding to stress of possible connection success. All the while ORD-AMS flight delayed 40 minutes yet never appeared on UA website or advised by crew throughout LAS-ORD flight. Frantic disembarkment of flight and did not learn of delay until arrived at gate. Set aside improving its operation UA could avoid stress and hassle of employees and pax if it could at least learn how to communicate situations and update flight status's. Seatmate had experienced same mess the day before but unfortunately did have to wait 24 hours for the next UA flight to AMS. ORD-AMS an hour late though ironically great news for us. The infamous and ancient B763 Ghetto Bird window covered in sticky goo but led to free apology wine from FA after I called attention to it and personally cleaned it. Announcements in Dutch noticed and appreciated. Crew notably pleasant. Baggage made connection which was merciful. Food markedly worse than AC and European carriers. Delays are too routine however and with the watering down of MP program I have already actively booked away from US carriers when flying to Europe on next two flights both from the States and Canada.

,United Airlines,Business Class,,19th September 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,As a Platinum customer I fly a lot with United and it is amazing how bad United has become over the last 5 years. Not only did they delay today's departure for a little bit of rain in DC and called it a thunderstorm but they also let our connection leave without us for our honeymoon. I am less frustrated when it is a business trip as I always expect that United does not make its connections. Last year I did not have a single flight on time and missed 6 flights. The business class had very uncomfortable seats the staff made the same announcement every 20 minutes for about 2 hours that we would be a little bit late. Then they made another announcement that someone would be waiting with information for us in Munich. All we were told at Munich airport was to go to the Lufthansa Service Center. The service agent sen us immediately to the departure gate but did not let the airplane know that there were multiple customers coming. So the plane left 5 minutes before we arrived at the gate after a wild goose chase through Munich airport. After flying for years and being vegetarian I usually bring my own food as I am over the monotonous and tasteless food they serve but today I flew business and I wanted some champagne and a meal. It is always the same and the quality of the food has gone downhill and the dessert has also not changed in the last 5 years. The purser came and apologized in person big deal however she did not have any information for those that got stranded in Munich.What about their new security video between images with kangaroos and people sitting in seats on the beach you get completely lost in their new bizarre security video. As an educator I can guarantee that not 1/3 of people have afterwards a clue of what was said because this looks more like a reality TV series or a bad infomercial. I have been to Africa Peru and Europe on three long flights and the movies between these directions do not change. In the last 6 weeks I have seen almost all of what is worth seeing so that's why I gave the Entertainment 1 star.

When I got to the airport I was advised the flight had been cancelled earlier that day. The ticketing agent said there were no available flights so I was stranded in Indianapolis until the next morning. She was unwilling to offer any hotel or any other compensation. The only available flights the next day had layovers instead of being direct. I took a United flight easily from IND to ORD the next morning. However the flight from ORD to IAD on UA382 was horrible. We boarded the flight late because there were so many people on standby. Then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours because they said they needed to refuel.

,United Airlines,Premium Economy,,17th September 2014,1,1,0,UnitedKingdom,2.0,no,On 21st August this year my wife and I were to fly United from Heathrow to Chicago and booked in early July. As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty. The flight through the night was unpleasant due to the aircraft being very cold which made sleeping almost impossible. Altogether not a very good experience.,,2,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,2,0,b161709b-935c-4dc6-b884-7630a202a4d5
,United Airlines,Economy Class,,14th September 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,After two years of planning I thought I had all my ducks in a row for a trip from the USA to the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane. I even hired a Travel Agency to avoid any mistakes on my part. Boy was I mistaken. August 25 2014 was finally here. I went to my local airport two hours early (as instructed) and sat there for six hours at the United Airlines boarding gate. We were told the four hour delay was due to the weather in Chicago. Ok not a deal breaker since I had a scheduled six hour layover in Los Angeles. The ticket agent at my local airport is the only good thing about United. She kept track of my schedule and issued me a new ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles when it became obvious that I was going to miss my scheduled flight. I arrived in Chicago four hours late and promptly went to the United gate for my flight to Los Angeles only to to find out that it also was running four hours late. I found another United flight to Los Angeles and got a standby ticket. This flight was running three hours late. Finally I actually got to board a United Airline plane bound for Chicago. Now that all the passengers are onboard the pilot decides he needs to refuel. After maybe ten minutes he announces that the refuelling truck is broken and that the mechanics are working on it. So here we sat waiting to be refuelled. After maybe another hour the pilot announces he was going to taxi over to the international terminal to refuel. Well now it's very clear that I'm going to miss my connecting flight and I can't get off this plane. Fast forward - we arrived in Los Angeles at 2.30 am and my flight to Brisbane Australia left shortly after midnight. I asked the United employee at the gate how to get to the other terminal and she bluntly said the airport was basically closed until 4 am and said I could sleep on the plastic chairs until then. I can't blame anyone for weather delays but the refueling fiasco in Chicago is unacceptable. The rude United employees are unacceptable.,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,fb3206b8-84a8-4ce7-9ea7-4bb31e75f84e

Brussels Airlines has not transferred to Star Alliance Terminal 2 yet where United lives so we had a mad dash across from Terminal 1. Got to gate after going through security-one of the agents said don't worry they were holding the flight a few minutes for us. (That's good service).

We experienced no delays the cabin crew couldn't have been nicer and the pilots seemed to go out their way to improve passenger comfort. The seating within the plane was large enough in economy and the in flight entertainment was excellent during the international flight to and from Glasgow. All in all I have no issues with any of the flights delays happen and when they do you have to deal with them its a part of every day travel and I'm sure every airline experiences them.

United is the only commercial airline flying into ACV. Food is never that great but that's pretty much the norm with most airlines I guess. Inflight entertainment is perfect with personal screens (777 aircraft if flying 747 then just multi screen). I am a silver mileage plus member so currently gain access to economy plus free of charge which is a bonus along with the extra benefits of being a silver mileage plus member. Outbound flight on time three seats to stretch out across which was great. Returning from SFO to LHR all crew London based. The service from the Base crew was the worst I have experienced from any cabin crew. I've even flown US Airways a couple of times in the past and anyone who has flow US Airways will know how scratchy their service is but even US Airways cabin crew offered better service than what I witnessed from the London base crew with United. Crew looked like they didn't want to be there drinks service only twice for a 10 hour flight food awful. Breakfast just a croissant and a couple of chunks of melon why even bother. Maybe United should send out WYR surveys to passengers and that way they would get a broad idea of a customers experience. However I'm not flying with United for cheap smiles and attractive cabin crew and 1st class service what I am flying with United for is airline miles premier service with mileage plus and an airline that can get me to my final destination the rest is just extra.,,3,2,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,5,0,f966528b-e98c-4e6e-81f5-43346a50881a

The customer service representative offered no sensical explanation as to why I got bumped. I wanted to ensure I would not be charged for their mistake. The representative assured me I would not be. Well that was not the case. On the day of my flight I found out I had double reservations for two different flights and was charged twice. I immediately called customer service to rectify the situation. I was on the phone for over an hour and the situation was handled horribly.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,10th September 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,After flying from Sacramento to Dulles airport in Washington and then on to Frankfurt it was apparent why United ranks at or near the bottom in the airline ratings. The Airbus 320 to Washington a 5+ Hour flight was brutal. There is no leg room at all the seats are flimsy and uncomfortable and it's impossible to recline your seat because of cramped space. It should be unlawful to pack that many people into limited space. The flight attendants were tired surly and unfriendly. We were in Economy but a row of seats right in front of us were Economy Plus they were empty on our flight. My husband needed to use the bathroom so I sat down in one of the Economy Plus seats until he finished so I could stretch my legs. An FA quickly came over and informed me I couldn't sit there. I told her I was waiting for my husband etc. She said rudely that I needed to return to my assigned seat. There were many empty seats on this flight but when people tried to spread out to get more room they were told no. One man asked if he could sit in one of those seats and was told no because they were Economy Plus. I don't get this attitude. The food was horrendous! There was no food service on the Sacramento to Washington flight which is inexcusable on that long of a flight. Aegean Air from Istanbul to Frankfurt a 55 minute flight served a hot meal - at midnight! There's something wrong with this picture. On the Washington to Frankfurt flight we were served something called a crostini. It had processed lunch meat and processed cheese. It was so horrible I couldn't eat it. Airline food has never been great but it's reached a new low. United should be ashamed of their service.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,10th September 2014,1,1,0,Singapore,1.0,no,"I travelled from Singapore to San Francisco only because it was a codeshare flight with ANA (from which I booked my tickets). Inflight entertainment was decent on the 1st leg of the flight to Tokyo presumably because it has just been upgraded with touch screen high resolution screens. However inflight service was horrid if you would even call it service to begin with. Flight attendant lashed out when I returned my tray (I was back from the restroom returning to my seat and thought it would be convenient for us both if I were to hand the tray to him since he was collecting the trays 2 rows before mine). ""Can you please wait"" with absolute annoyance and utter look of disdain before grudgingly snatching the tray away. The same flight attendant stepped on a pillow (which fell from a passenger's seat) while pulling the trolley and conveniently kicked it aside to the bottom of the passenger seat without a bat of his eyelid. On the food expect the same food you'll get from a low cost carrier. In fact you'll be better off with just cup noodles. It was the first time I have seen attendants hand out food without giving you the option to choose simply because ""we ran out of xx option so this is your only choice"". Inflight service was scarce no one bothered serving water after the meals and before flight landed. On the 2nd leg from Tokyo to SF there was a huge screen in front which they call inflight entertainment. You have the option to pay a nominal sum for wifi access and watch the movies from your own smart devices. Food was as poor as it can get for an international airline with poor service all the same. Rude attendants were still present but I was spared from any lashings this time round (the lady in front got reprimanded for the most ridiculous reason). I asked if I could make an inflight purchase 4 hrs before the flight was scheduled to land and was told the attendant in charge was resting. 2 hrs later I asked the same question and the same answer was given. Just when I decided I am not going to let United earn another cent from me that flight attendant finally finished her break right before the plane commenced its descent and asked what I would like to get. Do note that the ratings were made when comparing against the inflight experience I had when I took Cathay Pacific and ANA flights from Singapore to SF earlier this year and last year.",,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,524ba1a3-b1dc-48c8-b8d2-f0d22b555e0d

The flight attendants were pretty friendly but drinks were only served 2 times and food was not served at all (on a 5.5 hours flight). There was the option to purchase food but in my opinion it should go without saying that complementary food is offered on a long-distance flight.

Boarded an almost new plane that was in pristine condition comfortable seats (travelling on miles and paid for upgrade to premium seating). Ready for a great flight left on time. The flight crew were terrible there were glares from the front of the plane to the back. Almost no eye contact with customers rude finger pointing. When the snack trolley came by they simply walked past directed their comments to the air in front of them and continued on - likely very few sales there! When coffee and drinks came by they were already past before we could even request a drink (we weren't really asked you see) and we had to call them back to get a coffee. When I went to the toilet the crew simply jerked their finger at me without saying anything and gestured me into a seat that was vacant to wait. They scowled at everyone. By the time we left the plane the people in the seats behind me across from me and the seats near the toilets (I heard them talking as well) were totally turned off by our crew. This was the fourth bad experience I have heard of with United in the past year from co-workers and friends. In fact I have as yet to hear a good experience from any of my colleagues. Also when deplaning they gave out erroneous information. They said that those with connecting flights would have their luggage forwarded and they did not need to collect it. It was wrong in that they do need to collect their luggage to go through customs. Fortunately customs officials were asking people to make sure they had their forwarded luggage. Terrible service. I was flying on miles so the value was great the plane was new and comfortable the experience the pits!,,4,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,5,0,ada83494-1417-49a2-b9f5-2d2ec697a883

Line up through security was long and slow due to only one lane being open (obviously not United's fault but still frustrating). United flight to and from Winnipeg are seldom on time and either delayed or cancelled probably about 70% of the time. It was no surprise to me that it was delayed an hour and a half. Ended up landing in Chicago about 2 hours late. On the way home mobile check in worked and the whole experience was positive. Got to the gate and seeing my flight was on time was too good to be true and it was. It moved gates and was delayed 40 minutes. Both flights were on an E145.

United's seat size just fits me. I was in a window seat when a medium-large gentleman a little round around the edges sat next to me. This man was not obese. He overflowed his seat enough that every time he moved we were shuffled together from butt to knee. I put up with it for half an hour and then excused myself to the aisle. I paced in the back of the plane for an hour. The attendants were serving whatever they serve and saw that I was near hysteria at the thought of returning to what awaited me in my assigned seat. They did find a solution eventually. A United employee was flying coach and they switched me out with him. But the new seat was only 3 rows in front of the gentleman who had been next to me and he had to watch this seat change knowing his size overlapping mine was the cause. These conditions are set up by United in planning an aircraft with seats that are way smaller than the human population of these times. They know this and leave it to their flight attendants to deal. Other airline carriers are tight too but I have heard and witnessed that United is the worst.,,1,4,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,3,0,893097c6-ead7-448f-9f51-4b7fd23002ee

New lounge at SFO is still pretty bad considering it's a UA hub and supposed to represent the USA to the Pacific Rim but it was adequate (although be warned the bar closes at 10.30pm sharp not so good for those of us on midnight flights). Food on 1 flight also not so great (overdone tasteless steak) but otherwise good - I think they serve starbucks coffee because it tasted so burnt I could only drink 1/3 cup even though we were going on 30+ hours with no sleep by the time we were landing in Costa Rica.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,6th September 2014,1,1,0,UnitedKingdom,1.0,no,My wife and I booked a flight through last minute.com it was really a last minute thing because we had to be in Auburn by the 22nd August 2014. We got a flight for the 21st August which involved a couple of stops. The flight was from Birmingham UK stopping at Newark NJ and then at Washington Dulles then Syracuse (outgoing). First the flight was supposed to leave Birmingham at 09.00hrs that left 3 hrs late due to technical trouble. Got to Newark NJ so late we missed the 14.50 connection to Washington Dulles. They then booked us on another flight from Newark to Syracuse that was leaving at 21.04hrs that never turned up until about 22.30 and because there was a little downpour of rain the flight was delayed it had never left Attica. We went out on to the tarmac to board the plane and was confronted with a plane that looked like something from the Fred Flinstone era. This was a tiny DHC8 turbo prop plane and we were buffeted around like a roller coaster. So for that trip we were delayed for about 12 hours. Not even a cup of tea or a glass of water was offered to the passengers. The way back was even worse we were supposed to leave Syracuse at 19.10hrs on the 2nd September 2014. Next thing you know the rain started to fall again flight cancelled for 24 hours. We had to spend our own money for a one night stay in a hotel.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,1st September 2014,3,1,0,HongKong,1.0,no,"I took a flight from Hong Kong to Newark. Appalling from the moment I stepped on the plane. The staff were very unwelcoming. My seat was behind the exit row which was empty - all the row was empty and seeing as I was sitting between a family who had been split up because of the shoddy seating arrangements we asked if we were able to use the exit row. The response (in an aggressive tone) was no! If you want to sit there its now been designated premium economy its an extra USD 170 each and you can pay by credit card! Note that this in the economy / coach section. The stewardess then made a big deal of slamming down all the dining trays on those seats as if to ""seal off the section"" - it all made for an incredibly unpleasant start to the flight. Aside from the small seats and lack of leg room when dinner came round I politely requested a cup of tea. The cup of tea was passed to me without any milk or sugar. I politely asked for milk and sugar. She stopped - glared at me and snapped - ""well you could have told me that when you asked for the tea"". By this stage me and the family I was sharing the row with were finding the staff so rude it was verging on comical. Then to top it off having spent thousands of dollars on this flight I learn that there is no free alcohol. Don't get me wrong I can go with out a drink for 16 hours but its a small touch to offer an alcoholic beverage as part of the service.

,United Airlines,Business Class,,1st September 2014,2,2,0,Japan,2.0,no,We are a Star Alliance Gold family. We purchased Economy tickets from NRT-IAH-FLL-SCE-IAD-NRT but I later upgraded to BusinessFirst with cash. The cash upgrade cost $1400 each. On the NRT-IAH leg the first thing that I found odd was that the FA literally threw the tablecloth to/at me at the beginning of dinner service. I think he just didn't care because throughout the flight his demeanor was cold. Small things like my wife's request for water without ice were met with the glass of water with the biggest piece of ice in it. The seat was great the food was about what you'd expect at a family restaurant and I'm ok with both of these things but I really had to wonder don't people who pay to fly premium deserve at least not passive-aggressive”service? I guess not. The NRT- IAH departure was an hour late due to weather. We were not able to make our connection at IAH. I bet United Airlines could have helped expedite passengers (through immigration/customs/re-checking) with tight connections. Our IAH-FLL departed while we were waiting for our bags. I informed the UA rep at the baggage claim and he told me they'd rebooked us on the next mornings 06.40 IAH-FLL. I asked if I could get a meal/hotel voucher but he informed me that since it was a weather delay UA couldn't take care of us. We feared that we might oversleep the 06.40 flight because of the jetlag. I called UA to ask for another booking and though there were 4 IAH-FLL flights that day our only options were 06.40 or 20.00 departure. Their website revealed open seats on all flights but the rep explained to me that those were first class seats and we weren't eligible for them. The weather delay on departure was caused by a typhoon. IAH is also known to be quite poor at handling international flights. UA made the decision to sell NRT-IAH tickets with a 1.5-hour buffer nonetheless. Maybe it's my fault for buying it but at any rate rather than stay up all night or lose yet another day with my family we accepted a better-timed flight to MIA. Our business with UA resumed two weeks later for the SCE-IAD-NRT return to Japan we took another carrier for our FLL-MBJ and MBJ-ATL-DTW-SCE trips. I mistakenly placed a bottle of honey in my carry-on which was picked up by TSA at security. I figured that if I couldn't get to my bags I could box and check it. I saw my bags were already gone so I waited at the side of the check-in line and figured I would wait until they announced last call for SCE-IAD. The desk rep soon did so and I politely explained “I'd like to get this in to my checked bags.” The man was the portrait of hypertension and stress. He acted as if the world were about to end. Eventually another rep nicely asked me to go get a box from the store across the hallway and I did and when I came back the stressed-out rep acquiesced and while printing the tape/tags repeated over and over “ The flights boarding/you've got to get on it/it’s leaving.”The flight was just starting to board. I am writing this onboard IAD-NRT. We've decided that we won't fly UA again.

The seats were really comfortable as they had the option to put them 180 degrees so that you can sleep (the armrests automatically go down as the bed reclines) and can sleep comfortably for a tall person. They also had plenty of plugs that accepts USA and other countries plugs. The seats have plenty of storage however found it odd that flight attendants won't allow you to stow things under your seat.

This review is about my last flight in August 14. I was flying from Houston Texas to LAX. There was a storm near Texas and we were delayed about 2 hours. I understand there are natural disasters out of the airlines control. The problem is how these situations are handled. First one of the flight attendants seemed annoyed by people asking if they could use the restroom and get some water. The other flight attendant was very nice and she tried her best to accommodate peoples needs. Once we were in the air they started selling food to people about an hour into the flight. I have a gluten free restriction and they had very limited options. I wanted the cheese plate with grapes and chocolate and they sold out! That was pretty much my only option. Finally we arrived to LAX 2+ hours late and the gate didn't work. So we waited once again to be let out. Finally it was time to go get my luggage which was taken from me in Texas because there was no more room for my bag. I was the last one on the flight because they had a computer glitch and they couldn't find my seat. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the problem. They didn't tell me if I should wait by the door or go to baggage claims once I arrive at LAX. Once I arrived at LAX I tried asking about my luggage but there was big lines to talk to someone. There seem to be many other problems last night. Finally I asked one United flight attendant and with an attitude she told to go to baggage claim. I told her nobody had explained to me where to get my bag and she was annoyed with my questions. I had flown in other airlines were my luggage was given to me once I exited the plane! It was a legitimate question. Once I was in baggage claim they had about 5 different places two pick up luggage. 3 out of the 5 screens was broken. I asked another Inited employee where I could get my luggage and again with an attitude she said ""Obviously it's right there can't you see it?"". I told her their screens are broken so no I can't see it. Most United Airline employees are rude disrespectful and not helpful. They seem to hate their job.

The customer service was the worst we have had. It was our honeymoon we boarded our initial flight in Barcelona Spain with a different airline they flew us to Germany at which point we were to get on our UA flight.

How the airline knew there would be weather issues that far in advance is beyond me. The earlier flight and the later flight taking the same route went as scheduled.

After much difficulty finding a number for the airline was able to get a different flight however leaving Aug 6th instead of 5th. Then asked to be refunded the checked baggage fee and was told I have to do that myself online. Checked the weather this morning and the skies between Winnipeg and Chicago all clear.

The service customer focus and experience have all declined in the past few years. United no longer values loyal customers and it is evident by their service and how they treat their loyal members.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,8th August 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,I booked a straight flight from Washington Dulles to Toronto CA. Keep in mind that this was a weekend trip and I was supposed to return Monday afternoon. My departing flight was scheduled for 3.20pm and we boarded around 4pm. The pilot announced that the door could not close completely so we had to wait for an Engineer to fix it. We waited on the plane for an hour. The Engineer came and it took an additional 30 minutes. We got on the runway then the pilot announced that Toronto had issued a no-fly restriction due to severe thunderstorms. We waited on the runway for an hour. They took us back to the terminal and after about 2 0minutes it was time to take off again. We got back on the runway went to the same spot to prepare for take-off when the pilot announced that Toronto Intl. issued another no-fly restriction and we had to wait 30 more minutes. So we did. Then later they called the plane off the runway and cancelled the flight. It took 2 hours to get to customer service so they could help me get on another flight. The Agents were so rude and barely attempted to help me find something that would take me to Toronto that night! Ended up booking me on a 5.45am flight Saturday morning. I left Washington Airport at 11pm. Saturday morning I got on a connecting flight through Texas. What was supposed to be a straight flight to Toronto took 6 hours! To make matters worse my new booking was out of Reagan Airport so I had to adjust my return flight. They gave me a flight back on Air Canada (the Toronto to Chicago leg). I stood in line to check in and learned from the agent at Air Canada that United never officially reserved the seat for me. I had to run to United get them to reserve the flight give me a print out so that I could return to Air Canada. I connected in Chicago. The United flight from Chicago to DC was hour late. I lost time money and sleep. United had no compassion and was unapologetic.,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,9816af0b-c3a3-45de-8f6f-e7ca760a7700

The girl at the desk just seemed so unimpressed and was very cold towards my family and I. Upon going through customs it was very disorganized and very little help was offered while at the receipt kiosks. While going through baggage check the man checking our carry ons was telling everyone that passed that our flight was cancelled. Mind you the smartphone app said the flight was on time early actually. We then got into the waiting area there was just a sense of panic going on and nobody knew what was going on. A flight attendant came and confirmed it was cancelled. Maybe 10 minutes went by and another flight attendant came by and said it was in fact running on time and not to worry.

While I have had my share of grumpy UAL flight attendants I immediately noticed a different energy in the FC cabin when I entered (I bought FC - it was not a complimentary upgrade). There were two male flight attendants being warm and welcoming. They were constantly seeing what passengers needed (it was a 24 seat 757). They knew how to handle every request and not just with a sterile perfunctory smile. The mood among all of the passengers was noticeably different. I'm not sure that many of UAL's FA's know how significant they are in creating an energy on the plane among the people by the way they welcome and serve the passengers. Most FA's know how to serve a cup of water. That does not take much skill.

United now operate from the new terminal 2 at Heathrow which is a big improvement. However upon boarding it was noticeable that the 767 was quite old (pre Boeing 'signature interior' and my seat was uncomfortable. The IFE system is also outdated and was unreliable. However the flight was punctual. The check in system for my return flight ORD-LHR was poor. Initial check in at the airport required using an automated terminal but I could not select a seat as these are allocated at the gate. It is then necessary to queue again to be allocated a seat. There is also not enough space in the departure area to accommodate everyone travelling on the flight. The onboard conditions were also similar on the return flight to the outbound (same aircraft type) except that I was bumped down into the standard economy section from the Economy Plus section. As someone who is 6ft plus this meant squeezing into a cramped seat with minimal legroom - totally unsuitable for a lengthy flight. In addition they ran out of meal choices so passengers had to 'get what they are given'. United also have a stingy policy of charging for alcoholic drinks at inflated prices. Once again the seat was not comfortable and the IFE system was not even working this time. Thankfully arrival was slightly early and the arrival process at Heathrow was most efficient.

As there are 3 of us this time I have to find hotels for 2 nights in a row. One positive that came of this was that United re-routed us to Knoxville via Atlanta using Delta. On the way back from Knoxville via Washington to Newark the United flight was delayed by 2 hours. We are then re-routed from Washington to London then Belfast. It maybe incidental to note that no other airlines had delays at Knoxville that day? At least we get home albeit some 4 hours later than expected.

Grumpy ground staff who obviously had had no customer service training. Luckily got reconnected through Delta who were obliging helpful and got us into NYC with no problem.

On the return trip the video on the plane was inoperative and we flew 10 hours with no movies or sound. The second leg from Washington to San Diego had no video screens available on the plane and the power plug under our seat did not charge our electronic device so we could not watch a movie we had downloaded as we used up our battery on the previous flight from Paris. To top it off one of our bags didn't arrive with the rest of our luggage and hasn't turned up a day later. Needless to say the airlines should have compensated us for the lack of video service during an international flight. The missing luggage might turn up hopefully! The crew were excellent.

This time however the plane I was getting on in Albany was late arriving and thus we were late taking off. This resulted in our flight arriving in Newark too late to catch the connection flight. Not only was I now delayed a day but I was told by the airline that I would likely have to travel to LaGuardia by bus or taxi but they would not cover the cost. This is insane. Also the airline did not seem to have any thought of giving a discount. I purchased a service and the service was not provided. In any other industry I would not pay for this.

Luckily it was better than I expected! The entertainment was pretty old and barely usable unless I wanted to go deaf by turning up the volume to its max. Since I wasn't using it flight crew asked me to swap with a couple who had a broken machine which I did. The crew member then forgot to give me my drink skipping my row completely until I reminded him. I was a bit annoyed but you know staff get busy and flustered. I enjoyed my flight smooth and got home safely so cannot fault it. One thing that made me smile is that an older crew member who witnessed me giving up my seat and then getting my drink forgotten thanked me personally and talked about how the crew really wanted to encourage good experiences for everyone.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,27th July 2014,3,3,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,Ever since Continental merged with United it has been downhill. My flights are repeatedly delayed for various reasons but mainly due to technical issues because they have so many old planes still in service. On my most recent flight my flight was delayed for five hours. The plane did not show up for three hours due to 'weather grounding' which was totally false because the weather was fine in Houston even if there were thunderstorms it would not have grounded for three hours. Then we were boarded and the pilot mentioned they had technical issues. I still do not understand why they would board an entire plane before knowing if/how long it would take to repair everyone sat in the plane for two hours until they were finally able to fix and take off. We were told to contact United for 'compensation' due to the trouble and I was offered $50 (only because I have status otherwise it would have been $25) due to our inconvenience. Apparently a new policy just instituted to give you even less because in the past for something similar I received $100 and $150.

Layover in LAX was supposed to be 5 hours - but rather safe than sorry is what I thought - and sorry we were to be: Upon entering the aircraft doors closed we were informed of a minor delay due to traffic restrictions. A while later a technical problem was added to the mix and they promised to keep us informed. It kept going on like this for a while until about two hours later we were released from the plane and tried to get on the next flight. After a total of three hours the ticketing agent kindly re-booked us on a Delta flight to LAX. We landed just in time to possibly make it on our next plane but the surprise was that our baggage was still on the original plane. So we had to wait even longer in LAX re-book the flight till next day find a hotel and so on. I asked UA ground crew if they could offer assistance with any of it hoping my star alliance gold card might come in handy. It certainly did not.

The idea that United now charges for alcoholic beverages on even such a long haul flight really sets them apart from their competition in a bad way. The food was probably the worst I've ever had on an airline and that's saying a lot.

Several passengers requested clarity to the problem and were given vague excuses and lied to several times. When the final flight was boarding I along with several others were denied boarding as the plane provided was not large enough to accommodate all reservations. I spent that night in the airport and flew to a different location the next day. The staff were unprofessional and created nothing but frustration and anger for many passengers.

After 7 hours we made it to Boston. Going home we arrived in Chicago and again on United's commuter connection we had another 2 hour wait while something on the plane was fixed.

It would be more efficient and there would be far less congestion in the front of the aircraft. For the flight from LAX the ground staff were very sloppy and inattentive. United has rules concerning the size allowed for carry-ons. Many passengers were allowed to bring full-size suitcases on board and of course the overhead bins rapidly filled up. I was pleased to see the staff at Dulles for my return flight were enforcing the rules and numerous passengers had to check over sized carry-ons.

I get to Newark airport for my 2 hour layover and see that my flight is leaving from Concourse A which has no lounge or other comfortable place to get work done. I take the dingy bus to Concourse B/C to use the lounge. While in the lounge I wasted a good hour trying to get Internet to work. I went to the front desk and reported that the Wifi was very slow. The lady behind the desk said that no one else had reported this then went on talking about her vacation pay hours remaining with another United employee. When I arrived in the lounge initially I asked while checking in if they were announcing all flights and was told yes. I did also hear them announce many flights but there was never an announcement for mine. I realized it was 7.05 and my flight left at 7.30. I raced to the bus to Concourse A by the time I arrived at Gate A20 was told that I would not be going to Halifax. I went to the customer care line where I stood for over 5 minutes while 2 agents ignored me. I sat there for almost 10 minutes while she typed away without saying a word to me. Finally she started telling me there was a flight from Houston tomorrow but no seats on it. I heard a passenger next to me say something about a flight to Moncton and asked the agent next to me if there was a flight to Moncton tonight. I asked the staff member to look into the Moncton flight and without saying a word she got up and walked away. Finally got onto the Moncton flight which left 40 minutes late.

They tried to reschedule our flight for two days later we could not go two days later we had to return to work in a certain amount of time. Once we were on a flight that day the flight attendant reported to us that there was no bad weather and had no idea why our flight was cancelled. We were then sent to Houston airport where they got us on a flight to fly into Miami where our next flight could not leave until the next morning so we spent the night on the floor at the Miami airport. The experience to our destination was horrible flying United and their express flights. Once we were returning home on United they did not tell us we did not have to pay for our luggage again and let us pay again Once again the flight was unpleasant. Once we arrived into Houston our flight home was delayed again the experience with United Airlines was horrible and the flight attendants were very unfriendly.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,13th July 2014,4,5,0,Canada,10.0,yes,I flew United 148 Newark to Geneva economy July 8. After reading other reviews I was prepared to expect less but was pleasantly surprised. The stewards and stewardesses were prompt with service and very friendly. Seat-back inflight entertainment provided me with many options to kill the 7.5 hour flight. The meal was good for an airplane meal and they were generous with drinks making numerous coffee/soda/water runs. The flight wasn't full and I was able to actually sleep on an international flight which made me happy since I had no one sitting next to me. We left Newark on time and arrived in Geneva on time. They got me there safely and cheerfully. What else can I ask for?,,4,5,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,4,0,35239566-8de1-4f26-8b43-6981ce651e9e
,United Airlines,Premium Economy,,13th July 2014,2,1,0,UnitedKingdom,1.0,no,"Like many people I flew United because of the great service I used to receive when Continental was still around. After the merger United seems to actually try to become the worst airline in United States history! On my last 4 trips United was responsible for 6 flights. Out of the 6 5 had major issues. The first trip had two legs. The first flight was delayed 1.5 hrs because the pilots couldn't show up on time. That caused me to miss my connecting flight by 3 minutes. Because the connecting flight was missed they booked me on the next flight (after an hour wait in the Customer Service line at O'Hare). Well the next flight was delayed nearly 3 hours - 1.5 of which was on the tarmac! On the return trip I checked in to my LAX-ORD flight only to find out my seat had been canceled. After arguing with the ticket counter agent that I indeed paid to be on the flight they finally called their reservations department. They in turn told me that I cancelled the flight. After more arguing they finally conceded that my seat may have been ""accidentally canceled"" by the ORD customer service. Finally on my last connection from ORD-ATW I sat around for over 5 hours because the aircraft that was supposed to take the route was late coming in. Really? It's Chicago O'Hare airport United's biggest hub! They couldn't pull another ERJ-145 into service? I could have driven to ATW and back (probably should have) in the amount of time I waited for the delayed aircraft.

Our first flight from SLC-Houston was delayed about 40 minutes which gave me 20 minutes to get on my flight in Houston to DFW. I gate checked my stroller so I could use it to get from one flight to the next. After our flight I waited for the stroller and it never came. A baggage worker approached me and told me that he couldn't bring my stroller up because it had a white tag when it needed the pink tag. I told him that I needed to get to a flight that was leaving in 20 minutes. He was nice and offered to get the stroller onto my next flight. I trusted he would and ran to our next flight dragging my two screaming kids with me. We barely made it before it took off. When we landed in DFW I again waited at the gate for my stroller. It never came. I again dragged my two toddlers across the airport to baggage claim. The stroller still wasn't there. I eventually found the stroller without anyone's help.

On top of that many flights did not have a crew on the ground and had to await arrival on yet another messed up flight. I feel for the employees.

,United Airlines,First Class,,6th July 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,United's poor handling of airline operations and poor customer service led to two cancelled flights and nine hour in the airport on June 30 (ending on July 1 at 3.30am) for my originally scheduled flight #518 from Chicago ORD to Portland OR (PDX). After arriving 3 hours late into ORD on a flight from Munich because of an unscheduled stop in Boston to change pilots I arrived to find flight #518 from ORD to PDX delayed because of a maintenance issue. After three delays two gate changes and three hours the flight was cancelled. I was reassigned to Flight #627 scheduled to depart at 8.25pm. If my original flight had left on time I would have missed the weather delay that started at about 7pm and lasted for an hour or so. The weather delay did mess things up and flights were diverted to wait for the weather to pass. Our incoming plane was diverted to Rockford IL for a ground stop and then never made it to Chicago. We had 7 official delays several noted only after the original delay deadline had passed and then the delay was only another 30 to 45 minutes so not much time to go get food etc. We had 3 gate changes during the process the last of which brought us back to the gate where our plane for Flight #518 was still sitting still with its mechanical problems. Our inbound aircraft never made it no alternative aircraft could be brought to the gate even though there was an alternate aircraft available and the flight crew timed out at just before 2am when they cancelled the flight. They offered a hotel voucher but the closest hotel was 20 miles away. After 26 hours travelling the last nine being at ORD I left for a hotel I had to pay for an hour away in downtown Chicago.

I am on the verge of switching airlines for future travel due to the horrible experience I'm having. I used miles to book a ticket from Sao Paulo to Chicago. They cancelled the flight (UAL 844) on July 1 (apparently weather in Chicago) again (UAL 844) on July 2 and automatically rebooked me on a flight on July 4 with a connection through Washington D.C. There has been zero communication from United except for an automatic rebooking email. Hundreds of travelers are now stranded at a Holiday Inn on the outskirts of Sao Paulo Brazil. I will be stranded in Sao Paulo for four extra days! I consistently attain Premier Silver status and always defend United when other customers complain of how bad an airline it is. Since I fly out of Chicago O'Hare I know I have other options in terms of airlines. I do not even know if I will make it out on July 4. The hotel we are at has provided no information to any of the customers in terms of what is the next step. As United increases capacity to try to build revenue they need to not forget about what matters the most: the customer. If this is not resolved to my satisfaction I will be taking my business to American Airlines (or elsewhere).,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,e4401816-bd0b-415b-b72d-13d530a76161

This means long delays and dangerous conditions on board as people try to lift bags that are too heavy for them over the heads of other passengers putting them in danger. Indeed this last flight I took a direct hit on my head from a passenger's backpack that was too heavy for her. No attendant came to see if I was safe and uninjured.

In Chicago we boarded our connecting flight but were told we were going to have to sit on the runway for a while because of the thunderstorms going on. About 30 minutes later we had to deplane for our safety. When we got off the plane we discovered numerous flights had been canceled due to weather. About 15 minutes later they got us back on the plane and told us we just had to fuel up and that they were going to get us to Portland that night. So then we waited out the weather for 6 hours and finally it was clear enough to take off at midnight. However one of the flight attendants timed out right when we were about to push back from the gate at midnight so they canceled it and told us to go wait in the customer service line to rebook. The line stretched over 10 gates and wasn't really helping any customers. Called customer service instead and was told there were no flights from Chicago to Portland until 3 days later and the best they could do for us was fly us to Hartford Connecticut - a 4 hour drive from Portland.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,1st July 2014,1,3,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,June 27th 2014 - I usually avoid United because I have very rarely had a flight that wasn't delayed or cancelled outright with little to no notice. Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay. Nearly 25% of the other passengers on this flight were unable to get to connecting flights with this delay and were summarily told to pound salt when asked what United could/would do for them. Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day.

,United Airlines,First Class,,25th June 2014,4,1,0,UnitedStates,2.0,no,Flew UA 319 Global First last night connecting from Austrian Airlines and was looking forward to experiencing UA's Global First on their three class 777 as I rarely ever fly UA. Horrible experience. Started with denying us access to the Global First Lounge as we were on Aeroplan miles even though their website says flying in Global First grants access to the lounge. They sent us three rail stops away to the Lufthansa Business Lounge so we could shower after the 10 hour+ flight from Vienna. The Gate Area was a mess with over 300 people crammed into a small area lining up like cattle in divided rows for 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 lanes - worse then Southwest. The plane came in late. We had to move to another Gate Area from C12 to D3 for another aircraft. The second Gate Area was larger. After a 1 hour and 38 minute delay we took off. Despite only 8 seats in Global First they don't get to board first. You must wait in Lane 1. Seems like an odd policy. The seats and cabin are very nice no complaints. The video/audio choices extensive except the screen is a little small compared to other carriers. For a transcon the drink/meal service stunk. The flight attendants were pleasant but UA offers no menus no champagne a tiny nut dish of peanuts and almonds limited food choices (chicken or pasta) all served at once on a plastic tray. The quality of food was poor. The sundae was very nice. Now I understand why United is having such a difficult time. They need to check out what other US carriers are doing.,,5,3,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,2,0,2e034d04-b1fc-408c-8b21-18c06dc445f5

I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. I am not sure who employed these folk or why on earth they decided to work in the service industry but they were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like a low’ cost airline. I say 'low low' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don't understand this. They can't beat Southwest so you'd think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,25th June 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.,,3,2,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,3,0,1648178c-9dee-4d3a-881e-5398dcb0dd2a
,United Airlines,Business Class,,23rd June 2014,3,1,0,UnitedStates,4.0,no,In a recent long-haul flight (UA871) SFO-TPE business class again ran out of the Asian meal option. This occurred in 4 out of my 5 recent transpacific flights. The purser came and apologized. She said United loaded only four such meals into a business class that seats 44 passengers! With a destination that is Taipei it's astounding that United didn't bother to prepare more Asian food options. It seems to never happen when I fly Asiana Cathay Singapore or Lufthansa. It happens only on United. Is United hedging on meals to save money? And what is this 2-4-2 business class configuration? It's pretty bad given that for the same fare one can fly in a much more spacious environment on competing airlines.

UA has removed the entertainment system on this new plane both audio and video so if you like listening to ""From the Cockpit"" you are out of luck. Not everyone is always traveling with a laptop so on long flights the absence of entertainment will be very noticeable. The top of the slimline seat in front of me felt like it was right in front of my face and the new skinny armrests were very short and uncomfortable.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,23rd June 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,3.0,no,"My flight out from SFO was overbooked by 4 and there were some ""hold your breath"" moments until 4 people decided to give up their tickets and take an alternate flight. I had a connecting flight in Denver to Lincoln Nebraska. Fortunately I had a 3 hour layover in Denver which gave me plenty of time to walk from one end of the airport to the other for a connecting flight and believe me when I say it is a long haul. If anyone has a short time span to get to a connecting flight I suggest they arrange for a cart. Passenger space on United is cramped. I sat beside a big guy and had to lean well over into the aisle in order for both of us to be able to sit in the side by side seats. My return from Lincoln to SFO was a nightmare. I arrived in Lincoln got my boarding pass and when I looked at the pass and compared the time on it to the departure time listed on the board I noticed that departure was at least one hour later - which meant that I would miss my connecting flight in Denver. When I pointed this out to someone in the airport departure gate area they told me to get on the red phone to see if an alternate connection could be arranged. Once the plane finally arrived and I boarded there was still a good possibility that I would miss my revised connecting flight in Denver. I got on one of the cars that transport passengers from one gate to another arrived 15 minutes before the connecting flight was scheduled to depart and found that it also had arrived late and was just disembarking. This of course delayed the scheduled departure time of that flight. Finally to my relief I boarded the flight from Denver to SFO only to sit on tarmac for over an hour due to lightning thunder and rain. You pay for selecting seats you pay for luggage you pay for snacks and for the flight but you are packed into an exceptionally small seating space in which you cannot even fully put your tray down comfortably.

Pleasant check-in agent checked our bags direct through to Brisbane which saved us having to collect luggage in Los Angeles. First leg on A319 with only 8 in the first cabin was fantastic. One of the best FAs we have ever encountered. Food was very good and drinks flowed freely. Only gripe on this sector was lack of in flight entertainment. The aircraft was equipped with Wi-Fi but you had to pay to use it even in the first class cabin. Not much positive to write about the second leg on B737-900. One food option offered. If you didn't want it too bad. Not even offered a snack from the buy on board menu. Once service was over the FAs sat in the galley and proceeded to talk extremely loudly for the rest of the flight.

Overall the product is decent for domestic first class. Crew on all 6 legs were generally very friendly and chatty with the passengers (all were DEN or SFO based). They worked the whole 4 hour flight and were constantly refilling glasses. Food was a little bland but was served well along with fresh baked cookies. Problem is inconsistency in on-board products with old CO aircraft having in seat TV and UA aircraft with old overhead monitors.

I was scheduled to depart at 6pm from NY change planes in Chicago with an hour layover time and land in Minneapolis by 9.30pm. Departing flight was listed ""on time"". 5.45 boarding still had not begun - asked the gate attendant when we would be boarding since I had a connector. He informed me that they were about to delay the flight indefinitely. After advice from customer service that my original flight is unlikely to take off in time for me to make any connection in Chicago I am rebooked on a flight scheduled to depart an hour later - 7pm. However this means I will miss my O'Hare connection so that is also rebooked to a 10pm CDT flight. 7pm flight boards on time. Around the time of boarding the originally-scheduled 6pm flight also starts the boarding process. Chaos at the 7pm flight's gate as multiple irate businessmen who had changed out of their 6pm first- class seats for a time-saving economy seat on the 7pm scramble to articulate their outrage and get rebooked on the now-departing earlier flight. At 7.10pm the 7pm flight is finally loaded - and completely full. It's sweltering hot and ripe with body odor and very very dimly lit. 7.20pm: still hot still smelly still dark. Flight attendants are trying their best to be accommodating. The plane finally acquires a couple of pilots 45 minutes after scheduled departure. At this point I am getting nervous that I may miss my re-booked connector as well in which case I will either have to overnight in Chicago or drive the 6.5 hours to St. Paul. The plane touches down in Chicago only a little bit late despite the delay in take-off. Stopped on the runway in the middle of taxi - stops for at least 20 minutes. Flight attendant makes an attempt to ask passengers to remain seated so those with tight connectors can deplane first. His plea is denied immediately by the scores of tired and angry people who flood the corridor before the plane has even reached the gate. Fighting through 35 rows of people I manage to deplane with 10 minutes to spare before boarding call for the connection. Arrive sweaty and out of breath at the gate just as my phone brings up a text from United: flight is delayed until 10.30 because the plane hasn't arrived. The gate attendant changes the sign to read 10.45 instead. Once 1035 hits she updates it once more - to 10.51. In short she assures there is no possible way I will arrive before midnight (CDT).

The meals were satisfactory though I am getting a bit bored with the ice cream sundae. The inflight entertainment worked well though it would have been nice to have different choices on the return flight. The only thing United's front cabin had going for it was more comfortable seats than in the back of the plane however even that comes with a ""but"".

I travel weekly for work so I will continue to fly United but if I were a leisure traveler without frequent flyer status I would choose another airline.

Another time someone forgot to turn the AC on in the airplane and it was 90 degrees inside (it was a hot day). Each delay was at least an hour. The flight attendants were rude and quick tempered.

After a wonderful flight with Air New Zealand from Australia we then flew business with United within the United States. The 6 hour flight between New York and Los Angeles was a nightmare. From the small old plane to the noise from where the stewards were working( they couldn't help the noise as the work area is so small). Not to mention the very small unclean toilet. None of United earphones seem to work (I now know why most people on the flight had their own). The whole flight was a nightmare.

This was in the very early morning so there were no additional flights available for 5+ hours. After some research of the flight number that got cancelled this flight had been cancelled 2 additional times in the previous 3 weeks. That's one cancellation per week for this one aircraft. After we made it from San Francisco to LA for our re-route the LA flight was delayed an hour due to late aircraft arrival. Once we boarded we waited on the plane for 1 hour after everyone was boarded and settled in. Pilot originally said it was due to weather and admitted it was due to ""paper-work"" before takeoff. Unbelievable. We landed 8 hours after the original time we were told. United uses primarily outdated planes with no on-demand in-flight entertainment. When they do offer their on-demand entertainment like Live DirecTV it costs money. Long flights (7+) could offer good personal TVs but that is rare. Wifi is unheard of my flight months ago was promised wifi but once boarded they claimed the original plane had to be switched so no wifi. Customer service is atrocious also. We were offered $7 each for food at the airport we had to wait at but that's it. I know a friend who had two flights cancelled in the same night due to airline problems. As a MileagePlus cardholder much more is expected. When we tried to get upgraded on our re-routed flights the guy said ""Oh this is a mileage flight"".

They forced gate check of all carry-on bags for all the remaining passengers. On boarding there were tons of open overhead bins with room remaining including one right at my seat! Many people complained - the kind cabin steward explained that ""sometimes they just start gate checking toward the end because the bins are usually full at that point"". My bag was taken right outside the airplane door - the agent could have actually asked the first class cabin steward ten feet away if their walkie-talkies don't work. They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn't easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead.

Since the merger between the two airlines is far from complete I knew the crew would all be Continental and knowing how poorly the new United is perceived not just by customers but staff too the old- fashioned Continental Airlines flight bag I hauled out of the back of my closet scored me a glass of champagne as I passed through the forward galley en route to my economy seat. Left on time catering was decent (one area the new United hasn't yet cut to the bone) although movie choices were limited to new releases so I read my book and did some work. Immigration at Newark was relatively painless due to the early scheduled arrival time of 1200 beating the afternoon rush. Short visit to the United Club which is comfortable although the snack options are awful. For the second leg to Los Angeles found myself back at the gate I'd arrived at. Some infrequent fliers consider narrowbody hardware unsuitable for long haul as it is “cramped” or “claustrophic take it from someone who flew on the same 757 all the way from Berlin to LA the size of the seat is the same as the biggest planes (except 10-abreast 777s where it is considerably narrower) and the smaller numbers at boarding baggage claim and immigration mean small is beautiful. The second leg to California was quite decent enjoyed a chicken-and-blue- cheese wrap for sale and the view of the North American continent unfolding beneath our wing.

In Mexico we were switched from our connecting flight due to the scheduled departure time. The flight we were switched to departed prior to our arrival at the Houston Airport. My family along with several others in our same situation then attempted to obtain another flight. The United personnel at the Houston Airport were very rude and not at all helpful.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,10th June 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,The relatively short commute between Durango CO and Cleveland OH was the worst trip I have experienced. I have never had any trip since the inception of Denver International Airport that has gone without an aircraft maintenance problem. This recent trip held me hostage on a small aircraft and at the airport for 8 hours. I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night. We landed at 12.45 am. I have flown from different cities (Manhattan KS and Albuquerque NM) to Alaska three times and not once did I experience any problems with aircraft. The main difference was that none of these trips included United Airlines and Denver International Airport.,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,91d52e1b-4fcb-40f9-9cea-c4ef80d8ab29

Gate agents at the airport were very friendly and efficient. Security is very smooth here and the airport is overall pleasant. Boarding was quick and the flight was operated by a 737-900ER. The seats were comfortable and no one bought the direct TV. Recline wasn't much which made sleeping difficult but I was not in economy plus. The crew on board were nice but not as good as others.

She was so helpful to the passengers in wheelchairs and kept everyone fully informed. The crew onboard were friendly and very attentive. Always asking customers if everything was ok and picked up trash frequently. Somehow the flight departed 40 minutes late due to there being only one operational runway in FLL.

You do get what you pay for with this airline but they really should do something to improve on the overall quality of their planes and service. The 757s look extremely dated now - once white plastic fascias now looking grey/brown. Curtain divider between Economy and Business a tatty net curtain that doesn't cover the width of the doorway. On both flights the toilet illumination signs were flickering constantly and added to the air of shabbyness. The only long haul airline I have flown in the last 5 years where in Economy you do not get any inflight entertainment system. All you get is films on a loop. I had to wait 20mins for the loop to start again. Flew LHR-SFO last October and on the EWR-LHR route this time the same film selection was playing as in October. Particularly galling as I paid a cheaper price for a trip to Thailand on Thai Airways last year and the IFE was excellent. Staff whilst pleasant are genuinely uninterested took 10 mins to answer my call to ask them to get my bag out of the overhead locker as the passengers either side of me were asleep. You have to pay for the alcoholic beverages - $7 for a 125ml bottle of red wine is an unbelievable rip off. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in with the exception of Ryanair where you expect an uncomfortable ride. On the plus side there is an extremely good availability of economy plus seats and the legroom really is superb in these seats but this does not make up for the overall comfort of the seat. The price to upgrade to Economy plus is the same as paying for an extra legroom seat on Virgin Atlantic and is less than half as good.,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,59d458d5-0484-46f4-9784-5aa71eb3dafb

The most unfriendly lazy rude and uninterested crew I have ever flown with. Shouting at passengers to close the overhead lockers refusing to close these themselves. This is one of their safety duties! The service was slow no peanuts/snacks with the drinks. Dinner was awful cold by the time I was served and totally inadequate for a 7 hr flight. Beer/wine are for sale only and when I asked for a soft drink they offered water only! A second request for a soft drink was rudely refused. Inflight entertainment was terrible small screens and all channels started without any announcement so by the time you wanted to watch anything films were already running for 30 mins. I am a Star alliance Gold member and have flown more than most people but this flight was by far the worst I have ever experienced.

I could have leave with that but I could not believe that my return flight was cancelled and this time without a notice. I only found out because I couldn't print my boarding pass. I was rescheduled on a flight to LaGuardia and because the agent did not completed the booking I missed the flight and had to be put on another flight 3 hours later.

Snack boxes for purchase but I did not try any. All the staff were friendly except for a grumpy check-in clerk at Louisville. My check-in bag was 54.5 lbs so was asked to remove an item. I pulled out one slipper and that dropped the weight down to 54 lbs and that was acceptable according to the clerk. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. So I put one slipper in my carry on and went on my way. Flew on an EMB175 from Louisville to Houston which was way to small of a plane for that distance but I pretty much slept the whole flight. Then was on a 787 Dreamliner from Houston to Denver. Thought that was kind of a big plane for that flight but what a brilliant aircraft. New quiet and very comfortable. The plane was heading to Tokyo from Denver hence the need for the large craft. Then an A320 on to Reno.

All stores in Memphis airport closed around 6.30 and we were all starving. United did at least bring some food for us in this situation. We missed our connecting flight and had to call our hotel and pick-up shuttle to explain the situation. We eventually arrived at Houston around 11pm. There were only 2 people at Houston to help the customers arrange hotels and airport shuttles and they worked extremely inefficiently since they didn't seem to know what to do.

It was chaos and passengers all around were complaining of their own horror stories with United. I spent the night in a Chicago airport (admittedly a large part of my nightmare was O'Hare airport) and no one who worked there for United seemed to care that I needed a flight out because they were so overwhelmed with the number of flights that were canceled and people that needed to be rebooked. They didn't give me a hotel room because the problem was due to ""weather"" but that was simply not true. They told us on the plane that we boarded that we needed to go back to the airport because the crew had overworked their permitted number of hours and they had no other crew to replace them with. I told them I would literally take any flight that would get me out of that city and the flight I did get was canceled within a few hours of booking it. I went back to customer service and I felt like I was a bother to them for simply needing a way out of there to avoid sleeping on their floors again.

Finally some of the passengers around us helped to request everyone about the allergy. The second leg of Journey (Flight 1121) crew told us they will make a courtesy announcement.

The seats in economy are among the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The United staff - who were long time Continental employees - were very embarrassed and said it should never have happened. And of course it should not have.

The departure staff were some of the rudest uncooperative staff we have had to deal with. Having stood in ""row 5"" to board and submitting our boarding passes we were told our hand luggage had to be put in the hold as the overhead lockers were full. This was very unsatisfactory as we were ticketed through to Perth. There was no checking of legal size of cabin bags. We saw many oversize bags go aboard including a musical instrument case at least 4 foot long. People putting their second piece in overheads instead of at their feet. If this was policed there would have been room for all legal sized bags. As we are aged 75 and 77 we had medicine required to be taken on the 27 hour journey. After removing medicine we allowed bags to be placed in hold. As the plane was about to leave gate we realized our passports were in our hand luggage. On approaching the head stewardess and the captain and explaining we would be unable to leave USA until passports were returned. Only through the captains orders our hand luggage was unloaded and brought up to the cabin. Full marks to the captain he placed one bag in the cockpit and the head stewardess rearranged some other bags for the second one.

United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It's very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6'1"" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the ""storage"" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music.

I travel frequently for work and for leisure but this time I am unable to do either. I was scheduled to take off from LAX connect in ORD and then push on to ROC.

I arrived at the new gate stood in line for 15 minutes to find out that all those flights were canceled. When I expressed my concern about missing work the next day I was barrated by the agent as he walked away from the desk and left me standing there without an answer. Thankfully I was automatically re booked for the next day but not given any accommodation. I stood in a customer service line for 2.5 hours to discuss accommodations with an agent.

After trying to finalise online check in I received an error message informing me online checkin hadn't worked. Arrived at Manchester and told that unlikely we'd get seats together in fact the flight full so although we had seats they were yet to be allocated & we'd need to wait for further instructions at the boarding gate. Luckily somehow we went from having seats apart to having no seats to somehow having an upgrade to Economy Plus! No idea how on a full flight we managed this but was great. Fantastic legroom (would pay extra on long haul now I know how much better the legroom. Food very good eggplant lasagne was lovely. Inflight entertainment was very good. Flights ahead of time.

All beverages were free including spirits. This was in economy! Arrived on time in Louisville more than happy with my day flying across country on three different flights. Plus my luggage made it.

None of the United employees were at all helpful and are very disengaged at this airport and it seems like you are bothering them if you ask a question.

Both flights to PV were on time and landed a bit ahead of schedule. We weren't so lucky on our return flights. The flight out of PV was delayed about a half hour because our plane arrived late. The flight out of Houston was delayed about 90 minutes but wasn't United's fault. There were many storms in Texas that night especially in Austin where our plane was coming from. So again the delay was not the fault of United. When we finally did leave we hit a lot of turbulence but that was expected due to the weather. All in all United did OK.

Terrible seats extra cost for luggage what food is available is awful and expensive and now you have to pay for inflight entertainment.

I explained that this was unacceptable. I then asked if I did accept the flight for the next day would I be given a hotel room for the night his response was no because if the flight is cancelled due to weather then the airline is not at fault and does not have to provide a room. To put the cherry on top he would not look for other flights except for the one for the next day. His suggestion was that I researched possible routes home and come speak to him later when I found another flight that was more acceptable to me. I was at a loss. I managed to acquire a flight home that same afternoon to Toronto on Air Canada.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,1st May 2014,2,2,0,UnitedStates,2.0,no,MSY-EWR-LIS with an open-jaw return from LHR-EWR-MSY. I must confess I tempted fate here as I didn't want to leave New Orleans too early on a Sunday so I opted for the afternoon flight that would connect in Newark with the overnight flight to Lisbon. It was a short connection window (59 minutes) but I decided to risk it. Big mistake. Once we landed - wouldn't you know it - no available gate. So we waited an additional 40 minutes on the tarmac and then another 10 at the gate waiting for someone to operate the jetway to dock with the plane. I sprint off the plane and we were the last two people on the Lisbon flight. As it turns out that flight was delayed about 25 minutes. Our luggage wasn't so fortunate. When we initially inquired upon arrival in Lisbon they said it had been sent to Frankfurt and that it would be arriving on a TAP Air flight from Frankfurt at 3.25 that afternoon after which it would be delivered to us at our hotel. We left Lisbon the next morning and checked at the airport to see where our luggage was. No idea they said - the last reported location of the bags was Frankfurt. Off we flew to Paris - without luggage. Arriving at Paris-Orly (where there is no United presence) the only help we got was from a French ground services attendant who was nice enough and took our information as to where we were staying (in Normandy) but could offer little else. We spent the next 3 nights in Normandy with no luggage and no one attempted to contact us about it. Four days later finally someone from United got a hold of us and told us our luggage had arrived at London Heathrow. Since that was our final night of the trip we just opted to pick it up at the airport the next morning upon check-in and change at the airport lest we go through the hassle of yet another botched bag delivery. Only when we arrived at LHR we were told that our bags were already sent ahead to Newark on an earlier BA flight. So here we were - at the conclusion of an 8-day trip with no luggage. At least we'd be able to collect our bags once we arrived back home in New Orleans. Our bags never made it from Newark that evening. They'd come the next day they said. Finally at 2 in the afternoon almost nine days after I'd checked in the bag I was reunited with it.

On our last evening in Richmond a few short hrs from our next departure time and at 2am in the morning the doorbell rang and our luggage appeared for which I then had to pay another $25 to get it back on the plane for our return trip to Columbus. Just when things couldn't get any worse the ticket attendant at Richmond airport told me that my wife and infant's son were on the same ticket and my wife wouldn't need her own to get through security. We stopped and grabbed some coffee said goodbye to our in laws and stood in line to get through security. Once we reached the front of the line the TSA agent told my wife she needed to return to the ticket counter in order to get her own boarding pass. Unbelievable. So we returned to the ticket counter where the attendant who originally issued us our boarding passes proceeded to tell me it was my fault and my wife's name was not showing up on the reservation. Then mysteriously she found her name and printed the correct boarding pass. Once we got through security and to the gate the gate attendant made a snide comment about being the last one's on the plane and charged us another $25 to gate check our carry on bag-the same bag we carried on for free 3 days earlier. I realize United might have slightly cheaper airline tickets but please do yourself a favor and spend an extra few bucks to fly in peace with all of your luggage. In the end our lost bags cost us an extra 200-300 hundred dollars anyway and the service we received in Richmond was absolutely terrible.,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,1,0,5883d08e-a45c-4e43-9f3a-3c341e5139c1

We flew from Toronto connecting in Chicago and ending up in New Orleans. First they were an hour late taking off. The pilot said they were contracting out the baggage handling so they were slowly putting one bag at a time on the conveyor. As a result we missed the connection in Chicago. Then 3 (or 4 - I lost count) gate changes and delays. The we boarded then de-boarded. They didn't want to assign seats for 3 of our party even though I had bought and paid for the flights 11 months before they over-book and weren't sure 3 of us would make the flight.

Only gripe was that after a late Arrival NY-SFO it was announced that for those connecting to Sydney Australia that plane was being held (there were about 10 of us) and that we needed to proceed to International Gate 102. We all arrived there as quick as possible only to be told the plane was not going to wait and never was. The delay ex NY was not a UA issue - ground staff at Newark. Anyway - proceeded back to Customer Service desk where a fantastic attendant was very helpful provided us with a comp at the Crown Plaza near Airport and gave us some comfort packs.

Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly.

Food was not good and seems to be deteriorating no longer do they give you any fruit or vegetables but just one course meal and that is it. I also noticed they now charge you for a beer or wine I think they just changed this as of January 2014? I paid an embarrassing $6 for a Heineken which I thought used to be included for Economy Plus? Service was just ok and nothing special. I then flew from ORD to IAD and again Economy Plus but waste of money.

As someone said to us on the flight was that they are only after money. As regards to check in at Heathrow. What a mess. All electronic to get boarding passes. It was like a bun fight. United make a big thing about there new systems and app but have forgotten the most important thing. The customer. Luggage. Make sure each bag is under weight. As they don't take into account overall weight. Tried to charge us £150 for 1 bag over by 2 lbs. We transferred it to a lighter bag. As I said before only interested in the money.

After heading into the lounge which at EWR is only a United club not first I went to the gate which was chaotic. They called global services group 1 and I came in behind the one GS person in group 1. I was actually pulled out of line and held back because they said only global services. I asked about global first and group 1 which was being called and was promptly told first class is very different from global services.

My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge.

We then decided to driver home from Denver Co to Madison WI (15 hours) with two young kids.

The plane leaves at 9:20 am in the morning. The 767-400 was recently updated with the new sleeper seats. The plane was clean and very comfortable. The entertainment system was excellent. The crew were efficient and nice. The really surprising disappointment was the food. A breakfast was served shortly after take-off but after that there was nothing except some doughy concoction that was served an hour before landing. The paucity of food and food service was stunning. Most other airlines serve Mai Tais on flights to Hawaii but not on United. I might as well have been on a flight to Cleveland.

All airlines have problems and cause the passengers problems. Continental was not an exception. However I was generally pleased with the aircraft (the newest of fleets) and with service. I recall having been delayed at AUS on a trip to LHR via IAH with my wife. We arrived at IAH with only 3 minutes to spare. We were met with a cart and our passports were checked and tickets issued as we sped along. All that ended with the UAL merger. I got caught in FRA with the merger mess on ""the"" day and since then it has been a series of canceled and long delayed flights with missed connections and very old and ragged aircraft. Most recently I tried to fly AUS to LAX on a CRJ in First. The attendant grabbed my suit coat and started stuffing it in an overhead bin. I objected as I was to go straight into a meeting. Seems the closet had been removed for an additional rows of seats. We were delayed for de-icing then for a malfunctioning APU. Finally at the 2+ hour point we returned to the gate and I deplaned making an AA flight in time. I suspect this is my last UAL attempt.

The connections were typical subsidiary small airline service; nothing special nothing bad and on time. On my return from Washington our B777-2000 was delayed due to a fuel problem however the entertainment system was left on so we could finish our film. After a 45min delay the plane left and made up the time coming back across the Atlantic. This plane was half-empty and had been recently refurbished with a great AVOD system and spacious seating.

It was after landing in Newark that everything went wrong. Starting with the long immigration lines that wound around and around. My connection was scheduled to depart at 1.17pm and I was still at immigration at 1.10 even after enquiring about help from a United representative who was standing talking to a fellow colleague. She told me to join the line and when I ask what happened if I missed my connection she just tersely answered they will rebook you and walked away. At baggage claim there was no sign of my bag I was told to catch the flight and look for my bag in Fort Lauderdale. I finally got seated without a welcome or assistance from the two attendants standing at the door. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours. In the meantime however the empty seats started filling up little by little and I began to wonder if they were not just awaiting a fill to capacity flight. Not offered anything to eat. They gave us tea coffee or water and that was it.

Whole flight experience a bit of a revelation for me as I am used to flying Asian and European carriers. It was a bit like flying a short-hop domestic flight in UK - nothing much really to keep you happy while you are stuck in your seat. Maybe UA treat international flights like their domestic US ones.

A request for two drinks met by a terse response of ""We do more than one drink service this is United!"" Hugely oversized carry on bags allowed in the cabin. As a result the last few passengers to board are separated from their carry-ons and ordered to relinquish them even if they are of legal size. Purchased a roast beef sandwich on the 4.5 hour BOS-IAH leg it was tiny soggy and disgusting. On the 5 hour IAH-YVR sector departing at 2100 no hot items for purchase just snack boxes with cheese and crackers. I don't believe that United is any different to any other US airline these days.

Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage.

We were at Terminal B and at this point the service provided by United Airline Airport staff was very poor. Instead of providing us with a direct flight to Toronto we were put on 2 connecting flights these were delayed repeatedly until they were cancelled. We finally asked after waiting for 2 hours if there were any other flights to get home. We were put on an Air Canada flight to Toronto leaving at 2pm but told to go to terminal D to secure our seats and boarding passes but then were told to go to another Terminal and eventually found out this flight was leaving on March 13th a day later not 2pm on March 12th. Finally we went to counter 1 where a staff member helped fly us back to Toronto. We unfortunately had a 2nd overnight flight and although we left Honolulu on March 11th at 7pm we only landed into Toronto 6.45am Thur March 14th. The only saving grace was Air Canada offered free movies. We flew UA1715 and UA219 March 4 2014. Very long uncomfortable flight-no entertainment unless you paid.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,18th March 2014,4,4,0,UnitedKingdom,9.0,yes,UA28 9/3/14. Noticed online that aircraft had been changed from 777 to a 767-400 which wasn't an issue as the 400s have AVOD entertainment similar to 777 and are far superior in comfort than the older 767-300. The service on this flight was good after the food service there was plenty of drinks runs and the cabin crew were happy to oblige when you went to galley for more. I only purchased one alcoholic drink on this flight as united charge $7 for a beer which in my view is a bit steep for a long haul flight but typical of an American carrier. Having flown with united before I knew what to expect and I wasn't disappointed and most importantly I got from a to b at a reasonable price.,,3,5,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,5,0,6378b1f8-ca33-403e-9d5c-d967baab17e3
,United Airlines,Economy Class,,18th March 2014,2,2,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,March 8th 2014 myself and 6 family members and friends were scheduled to fly at 3.15pm from Punta Cana to Newark. Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service. The 2 lost luggage bags that arrived 24 hours after we arrived in Punta Cana the week before seemed almost trivial in comparison.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,17th March 2014,1,1,0,UnitedStates,1.0,no,YQB-ORD on 13 March. One reason for such low rankings is that I never actually ended up on a UA plane. Scheduled to fly out on the non-stop from Quebec City to O'Hare at 8am. The day before UA emails me that the flight is cancelled and they put me on a flight at 11.50am via EWR. Nope - not on United. Online showed the plane from EWR on-time into YQB but it never landed. Around 11.30 am the departure board shows a 3 hour delay for departure. There is not a single UA rep at the gate - and no one ever shows up to tell people what is going on. The pilots and flight attendant who are to work the trip to EWR didn't have any idea and were embarrassed that one heard it was a mechanical problem while the other heard it was weather. Every other airline into YQB was operating on-time or with 10-15 min delays due to snow in Quebec - all but United. I spent over an hour on the phone with my corporate travel trying to get on another flight - the first United agent wouldn't help my travel agent so she called back and got someone else willing to help. I ended up on Air Canada to YUL and then to ORD. Air Canada was fantastic! United - what is wrong with you? I never say never but unless it is mandated I fly on UA I won't do it. I was Platinum with them last year and Gold this year but I'll stick with American or Air Canada.,,1,1,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,3,0,a62c04c7-1ba9-4947-96ab-feaa39c8a960

While my bag was not over the size the agents take joy in making you size it and have the ""got you"" attitude.

Reading some of the reviews about United it would seem to be an airline to avoid however as it flies from my local airport I am more than happy to fly with them. The flights listed above all departed on time or within 10 minutes of schedule all arrived early allowing for hassle free connections. The service by both check in staff and onboard staff was perfect a lot of passenger complaints for this airline relate to staff attitudes well the attitude question works both ways some passengers are downright rude to check in and cabin crew. I have one or two gripes about the flights I am amazed at what is allowed on board as hand luggage are these people so important that saving a few minutes by missing baggage reclaim is of paramount importance to them. The entertainment system was not fully functional on the international legs.

After waiting at the baggage carousel for 30 plus minutes all 3 lost baggage claim stations at DIA were unattended on a Sunday afternoon for over 30 minutes.

United changed our flight to Mexico at the last minute causing our arrival to be over an hour later almost negating our travel to our resort. The morning of our return I received email confirmation indicating that our connecting flight from Newark to Syracuse was cancelled. During several hours of trying to reach them and receive a new flight to get home we were finally told that we would have to stay in Newark until the next available flight. Our flight from Cancun to Newark we wanted the inflight entertainment and wanted to pay for 3 screens. Between the armrest functions not working or the unit not recognizing cards we were only able to get one screen to work. My seat was actually broken and kept reclining back on its own. When we arrived in Newark on Wed March 12 2014 we were advised that we would be able to come to that airport to standby over the next few days in order to get one or two out at a time. We are a family of 5 with two daughters. We then were told that we could fly out on the 17th of March 5 nights later at our own expense. The cancellation 13 hours before was apparently for weather but when we landed the weather was a little bit of rain. We ended up renting a vehicle one way to Syracuse from National and a 4 hour drive later we were in Syracuse.

So to have my flights canceled and rebooked for a flight that doesn't even come close to when my connecting flight leaves the airport is a bit stupid. Now I have to have a longer flight just to get where I want to go by flying in the opposite direction of where I want to go. To top it all off I wasn't even notified of the change. Now I have to change my plans so I can accommodate the airlines wishes.

The schedule was perfect albeit a change of planes in LAX but only a short layover. Took off from Vegas a few minutes late. A short flight from LAS to LAX and the flight attendants passed by twice with beverage service. The plane was comfortable the flight good and we were in LAX before I knew it. Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means. A smile on either end goes a long ways. I have done many short and long hauls with United over the years and only once did I have an issue. United has treated me well and has my business.,,4,4,united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,,,5,0,b60db83a-bf24-4d2d-aaba-7bbfd44e0b83

Every plane had a mechanical problem resulting in having to re-book multiple flights because of missed connections. In January I sat on the Tarmac for 3 hours in Rochester because someone had forgotten to drain the water out and it took that long to de-ice. On my return flight from Denver I had to be re-booked 3 times due to mechanical issues and sat in the airport for 8 hours. The only reason I finally got out was because a connecting flight from Idaho landed too late and they refused to hold the plane. In my most recent flight out of Rochester in February the altimeter was broken and we waited 6 hours for parts to be flown in from Atlanta. Oh and - I had paid extra for aisle seats in Economy Plus and ended up in the middle seat in the back of the plane.

Then had to de-board and a few hours later the flight was cancelled. We had to exit through the baggage hall.

At every airport in the USA staff were at best ungracious and unfriendly. Everything was too much trouble for them.

,United Airlines,Economy Class,,20th February 2014,3,1,0,Canada,1.0,no,"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers.

After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well. The entire flight was very stressful and unnerving and after this experience I will never fly with United again based on the treatment of the man at the gate.

I made two trips from France to St. Barth, with three flights in all (Pau / Paris, Paris / Saint-Martin and Saint-Martin / Saint-Barth). These flights cost 1500 euros. On two occasions, I could not take the flight between St. Martin and St. Barth when I arrived on time from Paris. The reason? The poor organization and incompetence of the Winair staff. The first time, I had a ticket ""Standby"". We were many passengers waiting in the heat in a large hall. The hour of our flight had arrived and we had no information. After a while, they called passengers for St. Barts and people rushed and pushed for a place. Many people could not fly, and we were told that there would be no more flights to St. Barts. We then wanted to get out of the airport to go to the boat, but we were stuck in the airport. Finally, we were able to leave an hour later, and the taxi had to drive very fast to arrive on time to take the boat. I had to pay 20 euros for a taxi and 90 euros for a boat. The sea was very bad and I was very sick on the boat because of the sea and fatigue. I was up since 3am (French time) and I was traveling since 20H. When I arrived in St. Barth I had to wait another hour at the customs, and I did not have my car to go home because I left it at the airport. The second time, I encountered exactly the same problem. But besides, I had a problem with my luggage. The lady of Winair (the only one who speaks French) said that the luggage had gone to St. Barts, and that we could go take the boat. I asked if she was sure of herself, and she said yes. I had a bad feeling and looked for my suitcase in the mess of the airport. Finally, after 30 minutes, I found my suitcase in the airport, all wet. I opened it and inside everything was wet: computer equipment, clothes.

The night before our flight we did check in on Wingo website and again read carefully everything about the process. In the morning when we came to give our bags and we were informed that we must have a printed tickets (wasn't mentioned no where) and a print screen shot in the phone is not acceptable. Apparently they are the only company that a phone screen shot of the tickets does'nt work in the check point to the security. We had to pay Wingo just for a simple print of paper 600 Mexican peso which is about 30 euro. So rude! Of course, there was nowhere in the airport a place with a printing machine so we had to pay this rip-off. Besides us, there was another couple who had the same story. After arriving in Colombia we went to their customer service in the airport to complain, we demanded to see where was it written that we need to print the tickets, the girls who worked there couldn't find this as well and told us to send an official complaint to the company website.

Please note that this review is about my experience but all around us in Tromso people where very unhappy with them. On the way to Tromso from Bergen we immediately noticed that de plane was very small. Average sized people do not fit the chairs or seatbelts. Its very uncomfortable. Because of the small seats people lean in the pathway. Unfortunately the staff does not take this in to account to if you happen to sit on an aisle seat: you will be pushed around during the round of coffee. On the way back our flight time changed. No text or email. We just happened to check the app. It changed 4 HOURS. Which made our transfer window not 5.5 hours but 1.5. Wideroe didn't seem to care about all the people with transfers and took there time. We left with 30 minutes delay. They didn't inform us about if we would make our transfer, what our gate would be or anything. Also: before check-in on the way back they informed us they were overbooked by 1 person and offered only 150 to a volunteer to fly THE NEXT DAY. If nobody volunteered they would force someone of the plane. Upon boarding there were multiple Wideroe employees already boarded and seated in passenger seats. No wonder it was overbooked.

,Wings Air,Economy Class,July 2016,4th August 2016,0,0,1,Australia,2.0,no,"✅ , |  I flew with Wings Air (part of Lion Air) as a part of a party of four surfers. We travelled from Bali to Sumbawa Besar via Lombok on Tuesday 19/7/16 and made the return trip on Friday 29/7/16. In summary of our experience do not fly Wings Air to get to your destination, particularly if you are a surfer. Cost for surfboards. The cost is Rp 200 000 per surfboard per flight. This means that flying from Bali to Sumbawa, which entailed two flights connecting in Lombok, cost Rp400 000 per board each way. We could not find this information anywhere on the Wings Air/Lion Air website, which of course would have informed our choice of airline. The Wings Air employee at check-in at Denpasar told us that the cost is indeed not on their website. Treatment of checked in surfboards - My brother paid Rp 1 200 000 for three surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. His board case was left in Lombok and involved considerable time and hassle to get back in Bali. I paid Rp 800 000 for two surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. One of my boards arrived with damage. Communication - We first attempted to travel from Bali to Sumbawa Besar on Monday 18/7/16. There were legitimate reasons for flights to be delayed that day – some repairs were being made to the runway. The level of frustration and angst at the gates being used by Wings Air was fuelled by a lack of communication and miscommunication. After several hours of seeking information, we were told that our 3pm flight would leave at 6.45pm. We sought confirmation of this on a further four occasions as we were keen to not miss our flight. When 6:45pm came we went to the gate to check what was happening to be told that our flight (and our surfboards) had already left at 5.10pm. A number of other passengers were also left stranded by this action. We went to the Wings Air/Lion Air office to work out how we could now get to Sumbawa Besar, and how we could ensure the security of our four surf bags with 11 surf boards. We were amazed to find that Wings Air tried to make us pay for new flights as we had “failed to turn up to the gate” for our flight (even though we were only sitting 10m away, having been assured again that our flight would not leave until 6.45pm).",DPS to SWQ via LOP,3,3,wings-air,a lack of communication,Solo Leisure,,1,0,a218cc2d-6a3c-406a-9b8c-c211d4a665df

,Xiamen Airlines,Economy Class,July 2021,20th September 2021,3,2,1,UnitedStates,2.0,no,"This has been, by far, the worst airline that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. I showed up at Xiamen Airport (Xiamen Airlines flagship hub) 5 hours in advance of my flight for two reasons. First, I knew that my bags would be overweight (I was moving back home to the states), and I wanted to see by how much. I had some items I could discard to make the baggage lighter, but I wanted to see how much over I was. Second, since COVID still had regulations, I wanted to be sure that I had enough time to get through the process on time. Xiamen Airlines, unfortunately, did not make any of this process possible. When I arrived at the airport, I was informed that I would not be able to set foot into the international wing until two hours before the flight took off. This forced me to wait until they opened the wing. Once the wing was open, the sold-out flight loaded up the kiosks. The line was moving unbelievably slow, but I knew that the attendants were able to see me waiting and that I probably will need extra help. This entire process of getting through the line nearly took an hour and a half.  Once I got to the front of the line, the first thing that they informed me of was that there were only middle seats left. I said to them that they saw me waiting in line, and I am considerably taller than most of the people on the flight. Rather than give any explanation, the only thing they said was, “we know”. Checking my watch, I knew that there was no time to belabor the point any longer. I had three bags, and I knew that they would have weight problems. In addition, I would need to pay extra for the third bag. I was ready to pay for the extra bag, but what happened next was madness. I sent them countless emails explain my grievances with the airline, and it took them literal days(and one time a week) to respond to me. The fact that this could not be resolved in a matter of minutes was frustrating enough, but then for them to not care about my original complaint and say that it was my fault is what drove me to write this complaint today.

Boeing 787,Xiamen Airlines,Business Class,November 2018,4th December 2018,2,3,1,UnitedStates,2.0,no,"Seattle to Manila via Xiamen. My wife and I planned a trip to the Philippines from Seattle and decided upon Xiamen Airlines Business Class. The routing was Seattle, Shenzen, Xiamen and Manila. We traveled late October 2018. The seating configuration in the Boeing 787, Business Class was 2-2-2. The seats were lay flat for sleeping, but unfortunately were leatherette covered which meant one would slide forward when seated upright due to the slippery covering. Lunch was served and I chose duck. This was the consistency of rubber and virtually inedible. The 12.5 hour flight was uneventful, however during this time the cabin staff barely checked on us. When they did, there was a distinct language problem. We couldn't understand them and they couldn't understand us! One would think when one is on a international flight a common understandable language should be used. When we arrived at Shenzen we had a layover of 2 hours during which time we had to clear Chinese Customs and Immigration. After this we had to wait in a departure lounge without being told anything about our next flight leg. There were about 12 onward passengers waiting for the next leg. Eventually we were told our boarding gate and ETD. The flight to Xiamen was around 1 hour. After arrival we had to pick up our luggage and we went to the Xiamen Airlines counter to get a hotel voucher as we had 20 hour layover. Xiamen Airlines to not have a hotel bus or any means to transport us to the hotel. We had to change money to get a taxi. This was an effort in its own right. We did leave some of our baggage at the left luggage office at the airport, which helped. The next day we caught a taxi back to the airport. We go through security on entry to the airport before checking in for our flight to Manila. I should mention that boarding to Manila like the short leg for Shenzen was chaos. No boarding by class or seating, just go for it! Service on board was almost like a domestic flight, again a language problem. We arrive in Manila after almost 36 hours after leaving Seattle. It was nice to experience the friendliness of Philippine Customs and Immigration. The return from Manila to Seattle every bit as bad as when we arrived late (11:30pm) in Xiamen we had to clear customs and immigration and by the time that happened it was around 2am banks were closed and we had now money for a taxi to the hotel we finally change $20 with a Xiamen Airline staff member and got to the hotel around 2:30 am. We were again routed via Shenzen and had to go through immigration and carry ALL bags through security. The flight back was slightly better, but there was still the language barrier. All in all the Xiamen Airlines experience was poor. The airline should make sure the cabin staff have sufficient English to carry out a basic conversation. The airline should upgrade all staff to a level of what is expected from a good international airline. At the moment they are a 3rd rate airline.",Seattle to Manila via Xiamen,2,1,xiamen-airlines,they are a 3rd rate airline,Couple Leisure,Not Verified,2,0,67f62875-6a3d-453c-ae0a-53d6ddfdb19e
Boeing 737-800 / 787-8 ,Xiamen Airlines,Economy Class,November 2018,3rd December 2018,4,4,3,Singapore,8.0,yes,"Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen. Note that my rating here is for XMN-YVR, not considering SIN-XMN, and not taking into account the visa issues at XMN. If you are not a holder of one of the 53 countries' passports that qualify for visa exemption by the Chinese government, then you need to apply for a visa before flying. XMN does not offer visa services at the airport. The main reason for the need of a visa is, XMN does not have a usual transit arrangement, which usually doesn't require you to go through immigration. At XMN, in order to transit, you have to go through immigration, which means you are entering China and then leaving China officially, just to transit between flights. This is why people transiting with passports that do not qualify for visa exemption have to apply for visa. If you are unsure, please make sure you email your local Xiamen Air representatives to check. Regarding SIN-XMN, it was below average. It was an older aircraft, without individual IFE system. The stewardesses were willing to help and respond to demands, but they were typically brisk and curt with their responses. Food was okay, not remarkable. XMN-YVR was excellent. The economy seat was comfortable, and leg room was good. Food was excellent and more than sufficient. In fact, the stewardesses made rounds between meals to ask if people wanted snacks, like bread rolls, sandwiches, or peanuts. The stewardesses were very friendly and approachable, very willing to help the passengers. It is unfortunate that their command of the English language is below average, but if you speak Mandarin, then you are fine. All in, it was an excellent flight at a very cheap price. I think, if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's Boeing 787, then there is a good chance that your flight will be a very good one. But if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's older aircraft, then you may not get to experience the better side of the airline. Finally, there is no online check-in services for international flights for Xiamen Air. You can choose your seats only if you spend some money. Otherwise, you have to request for your seat at the counter at the airport. So, if you want to choose your seats, either pay for it, or go to the airport and check in early (I went 2.5hr before flight) to get the seats that you want.",Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen,5,4,xiamen-airlines,at a very cheap price,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,5,1,2c8c1147-3da1-46da-8145-443695eeb591

Talked to service desk, couldn't help, gave me a number to call. Called all the numbers he gave, none worked. Went on Google and called the number online. They speak Chinese in their automated voicing system. I had to get the guy from the service desk to go through it for me. Eventually answered but staff was so slow and gentle (my flight was in 2h). He tried to book my connecting flight 2 days later. I was crying so much, begging him that we have schedules booked and everyone will leave me behind. I don't speak Chinese and I don't know anyone. Finally managed to find me a flight the next morning. Put me on hold. Came back half an hour later saying their system crashed. Told me he couldn't help anymore, and that I have to hang up and call back and go through the line again. It was 1h before my flight and I still couldn't get my flight confirmed. I was crying so much that the guy at the service desk told me to charge some international calling on my phone and then he helped me call the airline in China. They got it sorted out in like 15min. I went through everything, got to the gate and my flight was annouced delay. For the return flight I went to the airport at 4am for my flight back at 7am.

If you are not Asian or don't like Asian food - please pack your own food. Found this airline to be just as professional, efficient, and friendly to fly with. Our flight did have to go thru 2 Chinese ports of entry (Qingdao & Xiamen). The flight was very comfortable due to the new airplane (Boeing 787-9). I noticed the increased air pressure (6000 ft elevation) and increased humidity did not dry me out and felt good at the end of 14 hours in flight. The flight staff was very courteous, attentive, and tried their best with English but Google translate came in handy to communicate. Wifi was available but not very good - too many people using it and not enough bandwidth for streaming. Food was good - 2 hot meals and 2 cold snacks in-between kept you full and satisfied. Very Chinese cuisines on all 4 legs of the flight (2 international, 2 domestic). Just remember, the airline is Chinese and therefore will serve Chinese food - don't expect Panda Express type food like the US. The food is primarily pork based with some fish, chicken or beef offering. If you elect vegetarian or muslim or any other special needs food, make sure you request this 24 hours before your flight. I saw some western folks unhappy with seeing unfamiliar Chinese food being served on a Chinese airline - I had to chuckle watching them eat the bread and desert for their meals. The only issue which is not the airline's fault was going thru Chinese immigration. We did not have a Chinese visa which is normally required for landing in China, but 50+ countries can ""transit"" thru China if you can prove your final destination is outside of China. The government issues a temporary transit visa for those that are going thru the country - it's good for 24 hours. At our 2 hr layover for refueling, Qingdao was the worst - they scrutinized and held up the entire non Chinese group of passengers looking for errors & past problems. They pulled 2 passengers out of the group for failing to register with a local Chinese police agency the last time they were in China. Military uniformed people surrounded them making you feel like you are in a communist country.... The airline staff was very good at preparing you for Chinese immigration - having your itinerary with you, boarding pass with correct name spelled, etc. Landing at Xiamen was much easier and nicer immigration folks. We even had time to visit the First class airport lounge using our Amex Plat card. Return trip was good and we even had an overnight layover and the airline provided a hotel for the night at no cost which was nice. We did have to pay the taxi rides both ways so remember to bring some Chinese Yuan (RMB) currency.

But I successfully purchased a ticket. If I purchased again, I would be certain everything is perfect before clicking Submit. I'm hesitant to call ""customer service"" as English is not their main language, and rules over customer satisfaction seem to be the situation.

Every passenger is wanded after passing the magnetometers. My baggage scan revealed two small Bic lighters, which were confiscated. Any lithium batteries in checked bags are likely to be removed. The airport is years behind many International airports, and is hard to spend time in. However, long layovers can qualify you for a hotel room (+5 hours), a city tour, or the lounge on the lowest level - with free Wi-Fi. The lounge was quite basic and drab. Hard to call it a ""benefit"". A room in the back had cots. In the airport, I was twice offered working iPhones for cash. With a landing announcement that mentions contacting quarantine if you're ill, including headaches, nausea or diarrhea, and the scrutiny upon entry and exit, I don't advise buying black market iPhones.

As a Chinese airline they followed the CAAC rule, which restricted people to use their laptops and other devices only when the aircraft reached cruising attitude and didn't allow passengers to switch on their phones at all.

The hotel is about 10 minutes away from the airport and costs about 15 RMB one way. Although the room provided was free, we had to cover our travel expense both ways to and from the hotel. I think this is strange. If you are only going to and from the hotel, the cash machines up on level 2 allow you to take out 100 RMB. Hotel was nice for Chinese standards!

She said that I was in the wrong line and that I had to go to the back of the other line (for the other check in booth).

Xiamen does not allow online check in for international flights. At the baggage drop in AMS, we asked whether the luggage could be tagged to our final destination. No proper answer could be given. Finally, at the gate we were told to pick up our luggage in Xiamen and drop it off again there. The flight itself was pretty good, except for the food which had no taste at all. Horrible. This airline does not allow any mobile phones to be turned on. Not even when they are on airplane mode. They need to be switched off, and if they find out you secretly use your phone the crew will stand next to you until you switch it off. WiFi may be used on iPads and Notebooks only. After a few hours the crew handed out arrivals / departure cards and you will need them. The crew will tell you that you won't need them for transiting however, you do need them. You will be put back in line at immigration if you don't have them filled out. Every single person has to go through immigration, even when your next flight is in 30 minutes or so. The horror really started when arriving in Xiamen. The procedure is as follows: Get out of the airplane. Walk towards customs via declare or not declare route. Go through immigration (with arrivals / departure card, passport, eticket) and you will get a temporary entrance permission. Go to baggage belt and get your luggage. Put your luggage through x-ray. Take elevator one level up. Now it gets tricky. If you have a 6 hours or more transit. Proceed to (transfer service) counter B11 for a FREE hotel. You do need to pay for travel costs. The hotel was good, but checking in took 45-60 minutes, they are so slow and don't understand English. After that return to the airport to the departures floor. Proceed to Intl. departures. Put your luggage through x-ray. Now you will find the check in counters, check in your flights and luggage. Walk upstairs and go through immigration (hand over your departures card and passport). Go through hand luggage check (they have very strict rules for power banks). If the power bank itself doesn't show its capacity it will be thrown away. No argument possible. Now proceed to the gate to your airplane that will bring you to your next destination. Never I will fly with Xiamen Airlines again.

Food was served and was pleasant enough. We were also given a packet of nuts and a bottle of water 2/3 into our flight. I wouldn't mind taking this flight again although there was one issue that perplexed me. Apparently ipads, laptops, tablets could be used during the flight, but mobile phones were not allowed. I honestly think this is rather stupid since a mobile phone works just like an ipad/tablet.

Boeing 787 / Boeing 737,Xiamen Airlines,Economy Class,May 2016,12th May 2016,3,5,1,China,3.0,no,"✅ , | My family and I travelled from Beijing To Taipei Songshan (TSA), and Taipei TPE to Beijing, both times with Xiamen Airlines in Economy class. The Good - compared to other Chinese airlines, we found the food and drinks service to be much better. The legroom on the Boeing 787 from PEK to XMN and vice-versa was very good, and the staff were friendly. An OK selection of IFE was provided on the 787 including a range of English speaking movies and many games. On 3 of the 4 flights the kids were handed an activity pack which they enjoyed playing (for about 10 minutes). The Bad - legroom on the 737 between Xiamen and Taiwan was poor. Transferring in Xiamen in both directions was ridiculous. When we checked in at Beijing, our bags were tagged through to Taipei, however we were advised that we had to go to a separate counter at Xiamen to get our boarding passes for the flight from Xiamen to Tiapei. It was not easy to find where this was once we got to Xiamen, there were no instructions nor staff to assist. Once we found the counter we were told that it didn’t open until 2 hours before the flight (we had a 3 hour layover), and there was nowhere available to sit and wait. Taking this in our stride, it was like a “red rag to a bull” when as soon as we boarded the flight to Taipei they showed us a video promoting how good Skyteam was, with their “Seamless transfer service”. It was worse when returning from Taipei. The bags could only be tagged to Xiamen, and boarding passes could only be provided to Xiamen. There was no specific transfer facility for connecting passengers that we could use to re-check bags onwards to Beijing, and no instructions whatsoever provided to assist in the transfer. Fortunately we live in mainland China so could find our way around the system, however it would have been utterly confusing for passengers who had never been to China before, with no assistance provided. If Xiamen Airlines has aspirations of being a true regional and international player, it needs to revisit its transfer services through Xiamen and replicate those of other successful airlines in performing transfers. Its part-parent airline China Southern does a dramatically better job handling passengers through Guangzhou.",PEK to TSA via XMN,3,5,xiamen-airlines,transferring in Xiamen was ridiculous,Family Leisure,,2,0,8b451eee-5a59-48b7-8cae-27dd41c98c68

No seat reservation or online check-in is possible with this airline. The KLM ground staff were unaware of the transit procedure in XMN. They told us to tag our bags to NRT but apparently it had to be picked up in XMN to be checked-in again. The flight on the Dreamliner to XMN was good. Loadfactor about 40% so a whole row of seats for myself. Food was served 1 hour after takeoff and 5 hours after takeoff. On both services meals were exactly the same. Didn't see the crew for the last 5 hours of the flight. Entertainment system had hiccups all the time and wifi was not available on frame B-2769. Flight was on time. Transfer procedure at XMN is troublesome. Crew on the plane told us not to fill out the immigration form since we were only transiting. At the immigration we were send back to the end of the queue to fill out the immigration form. We also had to deliver a paper version of the ticket with our names to the immigration which we did not have. They didn't thrust the itinerary in the CheckMyTrip app. After a lot of discussion they provided us the 24-hours visa for China. Don't follow the signs to the departure hall immediately if you have a long layover. The check-in desks are located in a secure area without any restaurants or shops. Check-in was opened 2 hours before departure and we couldn't get back to other parts of the airport from security. So waiting on some steel couches for a few hours without anything to do. The flight to NRT on an old and worn B738 was delayed for 90 minutes. Sitting on the tarmac without air-conditioning for 60 minutes. No reason for the delay was given. Food was good on this flight however. I had a bad experience on the flight from NRT to XMN. It was said to be a non smoking flight, but not for the crew. All of a sudden the seatbelt signs went on without any obvious reason and the smell of cigarette smoke appeared from the air-conditioning system. After 5 minutes the smell of smoke disappeared and the fast seatbelt sign was switched off again. This happened 3 times on the 4 hour flight. Having learned from my previous transfer at XMN, it went smoother this time. Altough not possible to buy food at XMN since creditcards were not accepted and the ATM's were out of order. The flight to AMS on the 787 was packed this time. Chinese people carry lots of hand luggage so overhead bins filled up quickly. I skipped the first meal because I wanted to sleep.

The Boeing 787 the same as the one on my way to Taipei. Both flights were on time. We had a constant turbulence on the first couple hours on the second leg of my journey, so the meal service was suspended accordingly. The flight attendants acted quickly as soon as we flew in a clean air again and resumed the meal service. There were a significant number of babies/toddlers on the flight to Amsterdam and most of them were crying and screaming constantly.

Also, they didn't transfer my baggage directly, so once in Xiamen, I had to get my baggage and check out, and then check my baggage in again.

You are not allowed to check in online or select seat before trip no matter how much you pay for the ticket. What's worse the first segment (domestic) of the flight opens its check-in 1.5 hrs before it opens for int'l passengers (they can check in even earlier online) so the 5 of us we were almost given seats far apart. When passing immigration at Dalian you felt it was quite informal. And then you pass a formal immigration at Xiamen again. Equipment was B738 what you may not expect to sit in for seven plus hours. Seat pitch was no different than any domestic. No PTV poor TV programme. Dinner was OK coming with bread pickled snack and fruit. Cabin crew not as good as they boasted themselves to be and did nothing to stop a Dalian tour group from talking the whole route and running up and down the cabin to annoy other passengers.

That said, there was more legroom than I expected, so it was not too uncomfortable. The seat only had an airline safety card -- no magazine and no air-sickness bags (They distributed air-sickness bags to people on landing approach.) The flight left a few minutes late. When airborne, a sandwich was served. Bland chicken and cheese. When I asked for some water after the beverage service had passed, the unfriendly flight attendant acted as if I had asked for the world. The flight was relatively uneventful until the end. Our approach to Sochi was during clear skies, yet the landing was rough ... right wheel first, the left, then a hard nose down. Passengers let out a gasp as we shuddered down the runway before the pilot smoothed out our landing. I wonder if because of the age of the aircraft that it was lacking the ""state of the art"" avionics that most aircraft have which make such landings rare nowadays.

And this flight was at least $250 cheaper than all other alternatives for this route with other airlines. My only concern was the fact that I bought the ticket online from Bravofly.co.uk and got a confirmation number with no other instructions. However when I showed up at the airport I was told that my tickets were cancelled because I didn't reconfirm the flight 72 hours in advance with a local office. I've never had to do this for a flight for which I had already paid. Good thing they had 2 seats still left on the flight and rebooked my friend and I without further issues.,,0,0,yemenia,Yemenia customer review,,,0,0,61987a84-18ae-43dd-a553-8315ea225eae

,Yemenia,,,30th May 2008,0,0,0,,2.0,no,The return tickets London to Bangladesh were cheap so I chose to try them out. Both the economy and First class seats are shabby. London-Yemen flight was less than half full on an Airbus 310. In flight entertainment was abysmal with the same film shown on both outward and inward flights. There is no personal in-flight entertainment system everyone shares the same overhead screen. Sana'a airport transit lounge lets the airline down. There were over 200 people in the lounge with only 3 filthy cubicles for men and none of them had a working flush or toilet paper and all of them were overflowing with excrement (I have photos). There was no soap either. The 5 hour transit wait was unpleasant. Sanaa to Bangladesh flight was full. The aircraft was infested with flies and it was hard to eat. Food isn't great but its ok for the price. There are no snacks even if you ask. No extra milk for tea either except the powder sachet that you get once with your main meal. Reconfirming the flights in Bangladesh was erratic. Local agent asked I present my passport and ticket in person and present a copy of my visa (I was told by UK travel agents I only needed to phone in order to reconfirm)! In the end I argued with him and sent him a copy of my ticket and passport by fax. Return journey from Bangladesh to Sana'a was the same on Flight IY0873 and the first class seat I was in (seat 2E) was very shabby and only slightly larger than economy but did have good legroom. The footrests were broken and there were flies buzzing around. Trasit at Sanaa to London was done in the bus and boarding cards handed out while the bus was moving to the transit lounge where more people got on. The official took all our passports and disappeared for a while. He then left all our passports with a fellow passenger and jumped off the bus. We had to frantically grab our passports because of the risk of theft. Sanaa to London flight had same food and flies and the stewardess explained that the flies were around because of the dates in Yemen. We requested she spray insecticide and she said she would try but it never happened. 20 minutes before landing at Heathrow she sprayed insecticide but that was because of UK rules. Verdict - Flight schedule was super crew dont go the extra mile. I will travel with them again if the fare is cheap and I am the only traveller otherwise I will give them a miss. Not recommended for families because of the really poor transit lounge and toilets.,,0,0,yemenia,Yemenia customer review,,,0,0,cf95416b-3331-4b4f-a7fa-092b789c96aa

There is very little in flight entertainment system. The headset does not work for most of the seats. Sana'a international airport is the worst airport I have seen in my life. There is a big dirty waiting room for the transit passenger and no facility to buy food or even shop. Strangely enough you have to request the guards to let you in the duty free region and most of them don’t understand English. The airport staff are very rough. The connecting flights are not regular. So if you miss one you are stuck at Sana'a for 2/3 days. Onboard food choice is very limited and sometimes I was offered no choice. Though there were options in the menu the cabin crews were giving whatever they want to the passengers.

Punctuality has been good except once and Yemenis are generally welcoming people which also applies to my experience with Yemenia booking-office staff in Sana'a. However I agree that most airlines in this region offer lower standards of aircraft and service on typical expat flights to Asia and flights with large numbers of deportees from Saudi Arabia can be a mixed experience.

The flight left on time and the staff on the plane were professional, helpful and nice! The plane was normal and I didn't have the feeling the seats were smaller.

We used multiple airlines and took carry-on bags on all of them. We are a family of four, and each of us took a carry-on suitcase. The bags qualified for carrying on in all of the airlines that we used, except for this one. Ridiculous enough, the trip that we used XL airways was an international trip from Paris to New York. At the airport, XL airways had a small compartment to measure the bags that they said the bag needed to fit in, including the wheels. It seems like they were doing this scam often enough because when we were boarding there were three guys ready to take ""the bags that people couldn't take as carry-ons"" in the plane. The representative told us that it was going to be $100 euros per bag and they took our passports and put us aside with many other people who were going through the same thing we were going through. They pretty much kept us until everyone boarded and told us that if we were going to take the flight, we needed to pay 65 euros per bag and he acted like he was doing us a favor. This was our flight to come home from a long trip, it was really late at night, and we had our six and nine year old exhausted kids with us, so we didn't see any other option than to pay them for the four bags. This is what they have on their website to pay for checked in bags. Also, during boarding time I have never seen an airline as disorganized as this one. There were no lines and they just called everyone at once. Inside the plane, there was no entertainment and the plane inside was very uncomfortable for a trans-atlantic trip. The only bright spot was that the crew was really nice to us, and they served one hot meal during the flight. Do not fly with this airline, they are not worth it, and if it is a family trip, even worse. Here are the measurements that most airlines advertise as carry on: 22 x 14 x 9 in And here is theirs: 21.7 in high X 13.8 in wide X 9.8 in deep. They are not really that much different. We had measured them before we left for the airport, as well as had carried them on several flights previously.

They charge you for every little thing, like blankets, any drink other than water, they serve one meal per flight, which can only be described as disgusting.

If you are looking for a stressful experience book your flight with this airline! To begin with when leaving NY for a much anticipated trip we accidentally brought an expired passport. I know horrible mistake! Since we arrived well ahead of time I thought I’d call a friend to get my current passport and bring it to the airport for me which would take less than 1 hour. The agent at the desk said we must have the passport an hour before take off. He gave me a phone number to call to see what would happen if I didn’t get the passport in time. I called and nobody answered. I told the agent then he said yes well they don’t reopen until 9am so that didn’t help much. My friend got my passport to me about 55 minutes prior to the flight departure time and they refused to let us check in. I was told the check in was closed because the check in staff needed to leave the counter to go downstairs to start boarding. If they had enough employees I would have been in that flight. It gets worse! So we missed the flight then called 9am when customer service reopened and I was told they couldn’t do anything to help me. If I wanted they would sell me new tickets for the same price for the following day. I had non refundable hotel reservations and already lost one night. Was so upset with this airline that I decided to just book a different airline for less money to get to Pairs. In the return trip my experience wasn’t much better! We got to the airport with plenty of time To spare and found XL Airways counter but no employees were there. A sign said they were closed? No further information given! We walked around to find out they were set up in a different spot. Not sure why they couldn’t have put up a sign telling us where to go. Other passengers were walking around just as confused and annoyed as us. After checking in our luggage and weighing our carry on luggage we went to the boarding area. When boarding the plane we got stopped and were told our carry on was too big. I explained that the lady at check-in weighed it for us and said it was under the allowable weight. Then the woman at boarding said no actually your daughters tote is too large. It was a fabric shopping bag with a neck pillow, some snacks and a sweater. I showed her that if you squeeze it, it scrunches up so small and it would have no problem fitting under a seat. She wasn’t allowing it at all. She said if we didn’t pay $100 for the extra bag that we couldn’t get on the plane. $100 for a shopping bag! We flew throughout Europe on several airlines with the same luggage and never encountered this issue! Not even with airlines that have a lower weight limit.

I was scheduled to leave on a flight 2 days ago at 9:30 pm. The flight's gate kept being changed for hours after the departure time until it was ultimately CANCELLED around 2 am. Then, they had us stand in the line waiting for a representative to speak to each traveler individually about rescheduling our flights. We waited in this line until 4 am without anyone being spoken to. Then, they made an announcement that they had hotels reserved for us and that we were just waiting for buses to take us there. An hour later, they noted that no buses were on the way and that there were no hotel rooms reserved. They did not provide us with water or answers/information as to when our flight was being rescheduled to. The staff members insulted passengers calling us rude, disrespectful, and annoying for voicing our concern and frustration. They refused to speak to us and did not answer a single question. We could not leave the airport because they would not release our luggage. After we were forced to sleep on the bare floor of the airport, they said that the flight would be rescheduled to the next day at 7:30 pm. We lined up for check in at 4:30, as instructed. The XL representatives/staff members said that we were ""misbehaving"" so they chose to delay check in until 6 pm. We finally checked in. The flight was re-listed as being scheduled for 9:30 pm. We waited at the gate until 11:30, when they claimed that they were commencing boarding. We stood in line waiting for boarding until 12:45 pm. At this time, they CANCELLED the flight again. Then, XL threatened to have any passengers that complained or showed anger arrested. They instructed us to go pick up our luggage at the carousel. We went to the carousel, where we waited until 4 am. At 4 am, we were told that no luggage would be released to us, and that no other information would be given. I left the airport. I received an email at 3:00 pm notifying me that the flight was scheduled for 2:00 am the following morning. Then, this flight was also cancelled. 3 flights cancelled. They still have our luggage.

,XL Airways France,Economy Class,August 2017,31st August 2017,5,5,5,UnitedStates,10.0,yes,"Paris to Los Angeles. I was skeptical about flying with this airline before I booked. I had read prior reviews and the ratings were very low. I felt that I should contribute with regards to the overall service that I received from XL Airways. My fare was excellent. I paid more for connecting within Europe then flying across the world.  Crew, attentive and very friendly. I received lunch, dinner and snack, as well as headphones. Basic water, tea and coffee provided with meals and throughout the flight. Anything else, needed to be paid for. I understood that before I booked. It's a low cost airline so basic caffinated drinks and or specialty drinks as well as blankets incur an extra charge. The blanket came in a colorful pouch with a blow up half moon pillow and eye mask, for 8 Euros. Credit cards are accepted onboard. They provided duty free purchases before landing. As for Internet, there was a fee to watch movies and listen to music for 9.95. You needed to download the airlines app before departure. If you didn't want to purchase internet to view and listen to music/movies, the aircraft did have three tv's on the plane, in which they played 3 movies and a travel documentary on a particular destination for the long flight. I found the movies entertaining and family oriented. The seats were comfortable for me but of course just average, it's economy class. So please consider this if you are tall! If you need extra legroom, economy plus for an extra fee is available before confirming your flight. The aircraft was very clean and facilities were positioned properly on the aircraft with several almost available at a time. The last check-in was an hour before departure, so get there early. No exceptions are made and is a strict policy that the airline adheres to.  I witnessed two customers that tried checking in 6 mins after the airline closed the check in counters and were still denied check in. As for carry on, strict 5kg allowance, one personal hand bag and one carry on only. If you exceeded the 5kg weight, the bag is checked to your destination but with no additional fee to do so, which is nice. I'll definitely use XL Airways again in the future. I found the airline to be great for the overall. I was very pleased with their services! I have a disability and the crew was wonderful in accommodating me and making sure I had proper assistance before boarding and when we arrived to the final destination.

I did a ton of research and looked for reviews and couldn't really find reviews base off the experience of their airline. Some of these reviews for XL I feel are from people that expected too much for a budget airline. I read the instructions and recommendations from their website, which I would read entirely to help you have a better experience. When I arrived at the airport I had my boarding pass printed before hand and was quickly greeted by an XL employee. They checked my passport and they checked the weight and size of my luggage. I had to check my luggage in the system, because the weight was too high. Upon boarding I was greeted by a very professional and flight attendants who spoke English and French. They realized I didn't speak French and directed me to my seat. Upon departing they did the standard procedures in French and English for departure. During the flight they provided a blanket, earplugs, water and a free meal! This is a very French airline and the food was very French and flavorful. They were very accommodating for refills of water, tea, and coffee that were free. The airplane itself is older so there is no WIFI onboard for internet. I was not disappointed, because they did provide a free movie and I also had my IPad. I would recommend you take a portable charger for your phone, tablet, or laptop. There are not electrical plugs on the seats for your electronic devices. Throughout the trip the flight attendants were on point and made sure the restrooms were cleaned and that passengers were comfortable.

The flight out to Paris was wonderful. The plane was empty so everyone had their own row to relax. The troubles didn't start until we arrived in Paris. On our flight to Paris they lost our babies car seat. When we went to check in today the lady at the counter was rude and unfriendly. We handed her 5 passports. Three for adults and two children. We had 4 bags to check in a stroller and we had our 2 year olds car seat. We have a double stroller. I was holding our ten month old and our two year old was sleeping in the stroller. In San Francisco they put stickers on all three pieces because the stroller breaks down into three pieces. When we told her that the stroller did that she rolled her eyes and said really. Then we tried to check in our two year olds car seat she said nope you can't take it, or you have to pay for it. When I explained they hadn't charged us for it in San Francisco she said well that is San Francisco. She then called the airline and they said we had to pay 50€ for the seat. She told us we had to go to a separate counter to pay then come back to her. As we were leaving she said wait let me put the stickers on the stroller. As she was putting the sticker on one of the pieces she noticed our daughter and said oh you have another child, we said yes, you have her passport to which she then said oh you don't have to pay anymore. Instead of apologizing she just said your finished. We upgraded to seats 4 thinking they would be wonderful seats because of our previous flight. But the seats had less space than before! They were so uncomfortable! Especially having a twenty pound baby on your lap. There was a section in front of us nobody knew was available. When I finally got the attention again of a stewardess the doors were being closed and she said that I needed to go to the gate to pay. What kind of airline charges for everything other than water, coffee and tea but wont let you buy up a seat? There were 8 seats open! Those seats remained open all flight. Our ten month old was walking back and forth in front of our seats holding onto the seats. We didn't notice but there was an ashtray in our daughters seat. In it was trash with liquid and food. It stuck and was disgusting. Our son put his hand in it. When I asked the stewardess to do something about it, she said you think it's my problem? I said to her I am not saying you own the airplane but you are the only one who's really able to do anything because you have the access to things to clean it. She rolled her eyes at me. 6 minutes later another stewardess came with gloves and took out the trash and in the process got liquid on us and said there I got everything. She went and got a napkin dabbed and said there I am done and walked away. 6th thing, for a couple hours service was non existent. We were trying to make a bottle for our ten month old so he could sleep and we pushed the service button but nobody came for 30 minutes.

,XL Airways France,Economy Class,June 2017,11th July 2017,3,5,4,UnitedStates,8.0,yes,"Flight Los Angeles - Paris with XL Airways. June 2017. First of all, when rating a low cost airline, I need to compare it to other low cost airlines and not to Emirates for example. When you book low cost, you should know what to expect: you know that for such a low price, you're not gonna have the high quality you want (for that, you go with Air France and pay $1,500 instead of $600). So, that being said, for a low cost airline XL is really good on several points, but of course some are not. Good points: - the free checked-in bag! Yes, that makes the whole difference, because most low cost airlines makes you pay for it, which then drags the final price up. So that was appreciated. The free meals in-flight. We were given full meals in flight. In addition to that, we were given free coffee / tea, and refreshments as well. Only alcohol is in addition. Food quality: good! I will not say amazing, no, but for in-flight food, it's pretty good. Very similar to the food quality you will get in Air France flights. This is because XL Airways is a French airline, so good products. Trust me after this you will be full, but if you want more, they have a menu with French items, delicious. - the staff. The staff was amazing, really. I think the best service I had on a flight. They are not after you to buy things (which I experienced in most low cost airlines). They were so helpful and dedicated. They give you extra bread, and do not hesitate to serve you twice for refreshment when asked. Overall very nice and smiling staff. Negative points - the seats. I would say the seats are my main and only complaint. They are very tiny, and not too comfortable. I'm a small size woman, so it was ok for me, but the poor guy seating next to me had a hard time. His knees were literally touching the seat up front, so not the best for a long haul flight. This is where you feel that you are in a low cost airline in case you forgot, here's the reminder. - the in-flight entertainment. So, they don't have in-seat screens. However, they do have in-flight entertainment through iPads or other devices. You can access their entertainment through your computer, or they rent iPads for $15 (which also include the premium package). Not a big selection of movies, but enough for a long haul flight. Personally, I enjoyed reading a book better, and also download my own favorite series before leaving to enjoy during the flight. Overall: for the price, I will use this airline again. Mainly because I do a lot of Los Angeles-Paris, and the direct flight, with checked in baggage and meals included is just awesome..",Los Angeles to Paris,2,5,xl-airways-france,nice and smiling staff,Solo Leisure,,5,0,7552a0bd-3348-4f11-bdf4-37ef94996753

We arrived at JFK 3 hours early and were among the first in line to check in. After waiting in line for an hour, we made it to the counter where our back bags and checked bags were carefully weighed. Thank goodness, we were all underneath the required mass. The plane was boarded and we we got on the electricity went completely out but in a few minutes, we were on our way. The pilot did an excellent job piloting the plane and even though we took off late, we made it close to our normal time. After spending a few days in Paris, we went back to check in to our return flight but they had already boarded and we missed our flight. We tried calling customer service but only got a recording and wasn't until the next day that we found out we would have to purchase a one way ticket home. On the way back after Checking in for our one way flight back to the US, the woman at the counter was not sympathetic just said so sorry. We did make it home safely and once again the pilot did an excellent job. Bottom Line: I would take this airline again but make sure that I made the flight next time because you will not be compensated or offered a discount.

The aircraft seemed to be a really old plane, and the TV's were broken (this plane did not feature individual screens on the back of the seats). But the flight itself wasn't the worst flight I've ever been on. The service was ok, and the food was edible. It is, after all, a budget flight. I would also like to mention that the captain did a great job piloting the plane. My issue with XL Airways is their customer service. We had checked in an oversized luggage at CDG, paid the fees, and followed the standard procedures of checking in. When we arrived at JFK, our oversized luggage was nowhere to be found. The staff at the terminal 4 oversized baggage claim counter told us that we just need to wait. We waited for 2 hours before someone finally told us that most likely it didn't make it onto our flight. We filed a claim, and they provided us with a phone number to contact to track our lost luggage. The number is completely bogus. We tried calling during business hours (8AM - 10PM weekdays) after ringing for about 3 minutes, it goes to voicemail, which is conveniently full. We try reaching XL Airways through several means, and finally we manage to speak to a representative. The representative tells us that we need to send an email with a detailed list of the items in the lost luggage. We do so, and wait for a reply. After doing a bit of research, I find a review dated 2013 about a lost luggage through XL Airways from CDG to JFK. The reviewer finally managed to track down their suitcase by going directly to JFK. So we decide to do the same and drove back to the airport to Terminal 4. After speaking to TSA, they tell us to speak to an XL Airways representative at their ticketing counter in departures. We make our way there only to be told that we need to go back downstairs to lost and found. Finally someone from Swissport baggage transport helps us track down our lost luggage, and we finally receive it. Nobody from XL Airways would provide us with any type of information regarding our lost luggage. They have a compensation policy of 20 euros per kilo for lost luggages, which wouldn't have even covered the cost of the suitcase itself. They have zero respect for their customer's belongings, which is completely unacceptable. Furthermore, no one from XL Airways was willing to help us in the least. They kept sending us to dead ends, and it wasn't until we showed up at the airport the following day that we received any answers (none of which came from XL Airways). This review should serve as a warning to anyone looking to fly with XL Airways. They have a 5kg weight limit for carry on luggage, and a 20kg weight limit for checked in luggage. First checked in luggage is free, after that it's 100 euros per bag. They also don't respect your belongings. To them, you aren't a customer that deserves respect, you are just a sold seat. I will never fly with them again, and their aircrafts need to be updated desperately. They should have been out of circulation years ago. I would not recommend this airline.

If you can accept no frills service of getting you to your destination then this might be for you. If you are used to full service airlines such as American, Delta, Southwest, United etc then don't take this airline unless you can deal with the following - narrow seats, poor customer service, difficult website, very restrictive baggage weights. We did it. It worked for us. We kept our bags to 20 kg checked (42 lbs) and 11 lbs (cabin) I strongly suggest you buy a travel scale for like $6 from Amazon. We made a mistake and paid extra for the exit row on our outbound flight. Lots of leg room, but the arm rests are fixed and don't go up like in all other rows. This loses you 2.5 inches in width. Having those extra inches helps. Our flight was only 2/3 full and most people don't pay for the seat selection. I suggest you do. Getting pinned into a middle seat or window seat and having to climb over someone on the tight seats is tough. This was the cheapest ticket for the busy summer season at $1120 round trip. My rating is low because service does matter. Website is poor in my opinion. We could not book return flight seats without calling airline since website did not let us do it after we booked outbound flight seats. Our steward during outbound flight was only capable of handing out meals. Had minimal English capability. Overall summary, if you are experienced traveler and need low cost, then this may work for you if you read up on what has gone wrong for others and avoid their mistakes. I hear all the airlines are shrinking seats (I don't travel much anymore), but 17 inch seat width is the smallest I have ever had and was the smallest seat I could physically squeeze my 270 lb body into without having to ask for a second seat.",LAX to CDG,1,2,xl-airways-france,budget airline with minimal service,Couple Leisure,,4,0,3593cd37-3c8e-48ad-885d-d5a0f5ddf3e7

I was really concerned after reading all the negative reviews and was pleasantly surprised to have a good experience. There were 3 of us and the money savings was a lot. Since we saved so much, I upgraded our seats to more legroom, very reasonably priced. On the way back, we were able to get an emergency row for the 3 of us, $50 each. The service going and coming back was really good. We had a meal, snacks, coffee, tea, and water free. Of course, there was other stuff for sale like on all flights. Legroom in general is not that different from most of the major US airlines, seat width is pretty narrow. The video entertainment is bad, but they do rent tablets with videos, games and documentaries for €10.00, well worth it. Even with all the extras, it was still a big savings. The worst part of XL is their online booking. It's easy to book your tickets, but if you have any questions, forget getting hold of someone. Reserving your seats - only if your lucky. I was able to book our seats about 3 weeks before our trip from SFO to Paris, but not return. When we went to the airport to check in I asked about getting return seats, they said ask in Paris, they couldnt. Paris said, you can't reserve seats until day of flight. We got to the airport about 2.5 hours prior to flight and easily reserved our seats. On our departure flight I noticed a lot of people angry about an extra charge for overweight luggage. Its shown everywhere what the weight limit is, so we didnt have any issues. The weight limit is very reasonable, 44lbs for a check in bag (no charge) and 5kg which is about 11lbs for carry on. If you've got the money to spend at least $400 and more for each ticket for an airlines with more frills go for it, but I think you would have to pay at least $600 more to really feel the difference.

This is something that could have been determined by 8:00pm, but the majority of the passengers did not get a hotel until 3:00 am due to the overwhelming incompetence of the staff of this airline. They did not assist, offer information, they were rude, condescending and complained to the rightly frustrated customers that we were somehow ungrateful for their efforts to not get us to Paris on Christmas Eve.

XL Airways France was the clear cheapest ($500 instead of $1800). Before leaving for the airport we checked online that the flight was still scheduled on time. Arriving at the airport it was scheduled with a 2-hour delay. Check-in was fine. We knew they were very strict with luggage size and weight so we had been careful when packing. Eventually the flight boarded on time but the plane did not leave the gate. After waiting for two hours, we were told that passengers were missing and they had to deplane the aircraft and everybody had to take their luggage back. The plane would leave the following day. We go back to the airport the following day. Plane finally left JFK but it did not go to Paris as planned it first stopped in Montreal to pick up crew members.

I called them immediately and they told me I should call their booking office in Paris. After getting the runaround to obtain their phone number, I managed to talk to a lady in France and I explained to her that I live in New York and I will be leaving from JFK. I asked her to reverse the itinerary, to make it JFK-Paris. She said there was nothing she could do about it and that she will submit the request to her boss. After many calls, I got from them an email address where I should send my request to correct the itinerary; which I did. After 4 or 5 days they replied to deny my request. However, after calling many more times, they agreed that if I buy 2 new tickets (JFK-Paris) from their site and send them the proof of it (?) they would reimburse me for the erroneously issued tickets for Paris-JFK. I bought 2 new tickets from their site, mind you each at $200 more than the initial ticket price, and sent them the proof of purchase, and they reimbursed me. The day of departure, at check in, they informed me that they only allow 40 lb per ticket (instead of the usual 50 lb per ticket) and they charged me $140 for the 20 lb excess baggage.  On the plane, you get charged $14 for a blanket, $7 per drink, and $5 for earphone to listen to music or movie. When I initially bought my tickets from them, I thought I had a good deal, saving $300 on 2 tickets over Air France's price. However, XL Airways were unimaginably rude and unfair, and they will find every excuse to deny you your due to charge you more,  and likely incentivise their employees to extract the max from clients. At the end it was mega bad deal as it cost me $250 more than if I flew with Air France and minus AF courteous service and always ready to accommodate you attitude and the perks on board: super food, good wine and free blankets, earphones, movies etc. ",JFK to CDG,3,2,xl-airways-france,unimaginably rude and unfair,Couple Leisure,,1,0,8d0d2177-efab-4ad0-9a36-f0777b0ec23a

Understanding that XL Airways France is a budget airline, my expectations weren't particularly high, but they failed to provide even the most basic level of comfort and hygiene. The smell inside the aircraft was quite terrible.  They're able to offer a lower price by fitting more people onto each flight. I'm not a large person by anyone's standards, but I found myself constricted by the width of the seat and squashed against the passenger to my left. Not ideal on a 7 hour flight. The aircraft had no overhead vents and the temperature was too high. No pillows are offered, and I think it's unreasonable to suggest that pillows aboard an international flight are a luxury. This is the first international flight I've been on that didn't offer a small pillow or blanket.  The bathroom was a disgrace.  The attendant did his best to mask the smell with some kind of spray, but it hardly helped. At no point was water offered to passengers during the flight. Again, it'd be absurd to suggest that basic refreshments are a luxury. What makes all of this worse is that I paid an additional $70 I paid for a 'seat upgrade'.

Because the planes were so old, the seats were extremely uncomfortable. There is no option to push your seat back because there was no space! Even if you had that option, it would be almost cruel to the person sitting behind you. I am 5’1 and my knees were almost touching the seat in the front. So if you are taller than 5’3, the economy ticket of this airline is not for you. I had to stand up a few times during the flight in order to have some blood circulation though my legs. Also, if you are a person who likes air conditioning, their planes are room temperature. Meaning, for me, it was hot throughout the whole flight. The food was decent, but the flight attendants were rude. You are only allowed to get water or coffee with your meal, for everything else, you have to pay extra. $4 for a can of coke!

I can only assume they have one cart and a small group of bag handlers. In short we landed at 10pm and left the airport at 12.40.

,XL Airways France,Economy Class,,15th October 2013,2,1,0,UnitedStates,,no,JFK-CDG. Once at the airport you will take your luggage to the shadiest check-in counter then navigate your way to the most isolated gate at your terminal. Your interaction with staff will be brief and to the point. XL does not win any medals for hospitality. But the planes are all throw-aways from second-tier airlines. You may find that you're travelling in say a Garuda Airlines plane from the 80's. The seating arrangement on XL is probably in violation of at least a dozen FAA regulations and if not it should be. Where seats are normally arranged in rows of 2-4-2 this airline opted for a novel 3-3-3 set-up. This adds an extra seat to each row but unfortunately the back of each seat is practically glued to the back of the adjacent seat and as a result the armrests between seats have nowhere to lift. You will be squeezed in so tightly that if you're even moderately overweight forget it: you won't fit. If you're taller than 6 feet you will probably hurt your knees back and/or neck staying in a contorted position for 7 hours. The seats don't really recline with the exception of a few broken ones that recline too much. The rows are so close to each other that a laptop won't open with sufficient clearance to let you type on it. The food will be nothing short of revolting but you should expect that.

I called them to try to cancel the flight. It cost me close to 10 dollars because they have a phone number which charges you for waiting on the line.

I read you get what you pay for - well I happen to have flown Air France also and they are no different than XL Airways France. The economy in XLF is very similar to Air France with the exception of IFE/ individual screens. You get two meals on a 10 hour flight - a warm meal after take off and a cold meal before landing. One my first leg I upgraded to Premium Economy for a measly $39. The only difference is a few extra inches of leg room (barely noticeable) and leather seats.

I only get up from my seat to stretch occasionally and always bring my own entertainment options, no matter what is offered in-flight. I don’t need a lot of space or amenities to be content, even though I’m not a small guy. That was the initial attraction to ZIPAIR for me, not paying for things I wasn’t going to use. Entertainment? Bring your own (every seat has a USB-A charging port and they allow power banks, so don’t sweat the electrons). Meals, snacks, and drinks? Offered, but must be paid for separately either before you board, or in-flight via a browser interface using the plane’s WiFi system. Honestly, fine with me. I brought my own snacks and water on board, and used WiFi to order some drinks. The flights were incredibly smooth, the cabin staff were a vision of professionalism and care, the planes were spotless, and the seat comfort was better than expected despite being in Economy. For that matter, buying the tickets through the simple website was a breeze, check-in at the airports took less than 5 minutes, and because I kept my baggage simple, the tickets were vastly less expensive than other options. My only gripes were cabin temperatures - for some reason the cabin felt just a bit stifling both to and fro, and the air vents were on the anemic side - and the WiFi was a bit spotty. Honestly, these are relatively minor complaints (especially WiFi, hardly a necessity), and I feel these in no way diminished the value of what I saved on my fare.

The value for money is way better that's for sure. As is the customer service. In summary: Check in process could have been better. Had to wait in queue for about half an hour. I think all passengers are required to manually check in at a desk for this flight. Or at least we were on this occasion. No fast track for business class. On the flight itself, the seats were very comfortable. The blanket provided was especially nice. As were the slippers. The restrooms were very clean and the toiletries provided were ample.

It was basically a microwave meal but still tasty. The fruit was fresh and flavoursome. Free Wi-Fi for business class.

The seats were a clean, comfortable leather and had more leg space than most American carriers. Once we got in the air the Wifi connected quickly so we could access email and order food. It's not strong enough to download movies or tv shows so do that before you board. Food options are limited, they run out quick if you don't preorder. I suggest eat early or bring your own food.

The food we pre-ordered was pretty good for airline food. The only negative is that the cabin crew never came by to check on whether we needed anything. Not a big deal.

They don’t have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we aren’t used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you can’t pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we weren’t allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldn’t even change seats on board although the seat on my husband’s left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you can’t buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing.

On the return flight, they charged us $120 for carry-on's that were not charged on the departure flight, these carry-ons were a backpack and a purse. How can a backpack and a purse not be considered a free carry-on? There was no sizer or weight scale on the return trip, the ticket agent was just plain rude and said if we didn't pay for the carry-on's we could leave them in the airport! Tried dealing with customer service when we returned home for a refund of this nonsensical carry-on charge and it's just dealing with one incompetent after another. They did no investigation, just said whatever their ticket agents say, goes. Another issue that we witnessed on the flight home was that of another customer. In mid air a rude flight attendant grabbed a woman's coat from the overhead so harshly that she ripped the woman's coat, leaving a large tear.

I still went ahead and booked my ticket to detroit as it was the cheapest option for a one way, and I had to book last minute which is always more expensive! I decided to pay for selected seats up the front with extra leg room on both flights and got really lucky with having no one in my row for the first flight. The second flight I chose a seat with no middle seat and was really happy with this decision. As it’s a cheap airline a lot of people do not pay for the seat upgrade, it’s really not expensive to purchase the extra leg room and well worth it for the comfort! Plus you will likely not have many people around. The food and drink on board is very expensive, but as I knew this beforehand I purchased food and water at the airport to take on the flight with me. I think I was lucky with the reliability of both my flights taking off on time as this was the one thing I was worried about! The seats are very dirty (front seat pocket) but all airlines are usually quite unhygienic so this was to be expected. The service on board I thought was great, very friendly staff and attentive.

Because we had already scheduled time off work and school and hotels, cars, meeting others in Barcelona, we were forced to buy connections on Air France. WOW said they could get us as Paris so we had to purchase 5 round air tickets from CDG to BCN, lost 2 days of our vacation, lost a night in a hotel in BCN, had to pay for a hotel at CDG, spent almost 2 full days dealing with connections, layovers (extra costs for food, car etc) Then several days before our DTW to KEF flight, WOW air changed our airplane and scattered us all over the airplane (kids in middle seats in back etc). We were one of the first to book on the flight (Was empty at time) and had paid to purchase upgraded seats together/seats together. Wow did not honor seat assignments. spent close to 2 days on phone / email / twitter support with Wowair and AirFrance and hotels/car rental scheduling, rescheduling, getting seat assignments, seeking compensation. Wow cites an EU regulation that if cancel 2 weeks before, will offer no compensation they slipped in just before 2 week window with cancelled flights. The staff was very nice but the company is just horrible. We were out approximately $2000 all in and no compensation or accommodation from company. Very sad because this was a long planned family trip that we had saved for and planned for a long time. The day we were flying, the company was offering ""free flights to people with the last name Valentine"". Very gimmicky and not taking care of their paying customers. Lastly, truly the most uncomfortable flight we have ever been on. It is a discount airline but so this is to be expected (though not at all discount when they screw you and cancel your flight). The economy / no upgrade seats are the most uncomfortable you could imagine, people were very miserable. Many families, could not move around at all. The first three rows were very large, like the people could do a pike/legs straight out. Makes no sense to give the upgraded seats too much room while the other 30 rows really suffered. The flights were packed and a lot of unhappy people. They charge for even water so the by the time you pay for water, food, definitely consider an upgrade, charges for luggage and if you are really unlucky - cancellation fees - you could fly first class with a reputable airline.

Although this seems like a nice offer, the tickets to fly out of Boston or New York (as they have cancelled all of the flights from Pittsburgh) are twice the price of what we originally paid.

As many know this company is low budget and a cheap way to get to Iceland and some major cities in Europe. We paid for upgrades seats so we weren’t cramped and also got the fare that included a carry on and a checked bag. While we were in the front of the plane if you don’t buy priority boarding passes it’s basically a free for all to board. At that point we sat on the plane and waited for two hours until they tried to figure out what was wrong with a “sensor” on the plane. They deplaned us after two hours. We sat in the terminal for another hour. After that. We waited and it was becoming clearer that we would not make our connecting flight to Dublin. No one on the ground knew the results and what would happen when we got to Iceland and with limited flights out of that airport the choice was do we wait out WOW or get on another flight in Newark on another airline at our cost. So ultimately WOW canceled our flight. As I was on the phone waiting on the phone I got a flight on Aer Lingus direct to Dublin and since WOW canceled our first flight they gave me the option. To cancel the whole round trip flight for my whole family. Which I did. They also said that they would credit me the money for our hotel to stay in Newark for a flight the next day. So I have to submit that claim later today. While I am paying more for my flight to Dublin now I’m not out the money to WOW as I have an e-mail confirmation of the flight cancellation and refund amount. So if they try to not refund me I can dispute the charges to my card. Some other notes the customer service people on the 800 number knew the flight was canceled before the people at the checkin desk. They also sorted me on to another plane 2 days later which would have really screwed me up for the trip. The day delay was not a super big deal. Also with limited options to Iceland I’d be careful booking tours in Iceland before you arrive. Folks were flying to Iceland and had these expensive tours booked and they were going to be out tons of money. While ultimately WOW made it right and I’ll get my money back I would not recommend them at all. However, with limited choices to Iceland if you must fly them to get there wait or give yourself an extra 24 hours before booking those expensive tours that might not refund you the money if you don’t get there. If you are just stopping over and connecting in Iceland to another destination with WOW Air pay more and get on one of the larger carriers.

I don’t mind no meal on a flight, not really a fan of airplane food anyway. I thought the connection seemed tight but it was what WOW advertised. So the flight out of Chicago was delayed. No reason was shared, no real info, it was just delayed by about 2 hours but the flight crew announced over the speaker on the plane. “They will hold your connections for you and we will make up time in the air”. Well that was a lie, don’t announce things that aren’t true. So once we got inside the airport multiple connecting flights were missed so there was a line 30-40 people long with 1 only, 1 WOW employee giving directions. Really WOW, you couldn’t do anything to assist all the passengers at that point? So after waiting 20-30 minutes in the line the lady tells me follow the arrivals signs and an agent will be waiting to direct you. Was there an agent, absolutely not. But I did find about 7 other passengers who were on the same connecting flight all wondering around lost wondering what was going on. We were able to piece together some info a few of us received different emails from WOW giving different info. By sharing with each other we realized we could book an airport hotel and they rebooked us on flights the next day. But not one of us had complete info and only by talking to each other could we piece this together. Finally after over an hour someone who worked at the airport, not WOW, got someone from WOW to speak to us and get a bus to take us to the hotel. We were told be ready for a bus to arrive by 3.30am in the morning to take us to the airport. Was there a bus nope, no bus. There were way more WOW stranded passengers at the hotel who arrived after us. The hotel called their shuttle service to come at 4am and take a huge bus full of all the passengers WOW stranded in Iceland and then again at the hotel. Huge thanks to Airport B&B.

It all start in Berlin when my flight to Keflavik was delayed by almost an hour, from 12.25 pm original time to 13.45. That meant that my connecting flight was almost impossible to reach. Before boarding, I got another email stating that my SFO flight was also delayed but only by 40 min (WW161 KEF-SFO 26OCT18 original time was 15.10 delayed to 15.50) Once landed in Keflavik it was imposible to reach my flight, even when my boarding to SFO was announced I was denied to cut line in customs by WOW personal. They stated that I had time. So when I lost my flight, I went to the WOW counter and was given the solution of flying to Cincinnati even when there was a flight from another airline to SFO that same day. The flight to Cincinnati was at 21.00 the same day. Also, they didn't give me a connection from Cincinnati to SFO, they stated that they where working on it and that we where going to get help by a WOW representative once we got to Cincinnati (other people where in the same position). This never happened, no WOW representative was there once we got of the plane, simply because WOW cease to exist in Cincinnati a few days ago. So, I never got a confirmation of a suppose connecting flight to SFO (some people did and others like me didn't. Their connection was from Cincinnati to Newark to SFO adding a 10 hour plus journey also there was a DELTA flight directly to SFO but was denied by WOW costumer service - I talked to WOW support to try to fix the situation but it was helpless, they even gave me a wrong booking number for my supposed connection, it was named to another person. Luckily I was helped by the United counter, an after an hour of back and forth, they could figure out what WOW messed up. Of course that I had lost my chance to get into the 6 am flight to Newark, so I had to wait for the Cincinnati- Denver 9.25 am flight, and then catch the Denver- SFO at 11.55 am local time (both of this flights where on United) And also, another layer to this nightmare, is that my bags are still lost.

During our 23-day individually planned US tour, my baggage did not arrive in Los Angeles or could only be delivered to Los Angeles seven days later. This was, according to the airline Wow-Air in Boston. In this baggage were all my clothes and all the cosmetics of both of us. This led to significant disabilities and rescheduling of the individually planned round trip. WOW-Air offered me instead of the required € 763 (expenses for clothes, cosmetics, medicine, contact lenses, increased fuel costs and parking fees) only a lump sum of $25 per day. This is €137 and is just a fraction of the cost we had in addition. In doing so, you plead that I can continue to use the newly purchased clothes and cosmetics at home. This is logically not possible, becaus many cosmetics in the end was duplicated and could not be taken home for space and weight reasons. In addition, all these purchases would not have been necessary if my suitcase had arrived properly. In USA you have to visit an eye specialist for new lenses. Even the eye specialist costs in the amount of 100€ were not considered. In addition, 13 calls were required to receive the case after a week in Los Angeles. I submitted a screenshot of it. But this cost assumption is denied. Just the detour from Death Valley to Los Angeles Airport cost us a whole day and is ignored by WOW-Air.

To say we were unimpressed would be an understatement. First off, I was unable to add any baggage to my reservation to fly out of Chicago to Paris, because of this we were charged almost $300 at the airport because we were not even allowed a carry on bag. We travel often and this is not the case with any other airline we have used. If we would have known this we would have packed accordingly. There is not much you can do about this besides pay the money when you are at the airport. Then we find out there is not free in flight entertainment, like the other airlines we have flown overseas. Also, the seats were so crammed together my husbands knees were hitting the seat in front of us the whole time. He could not even put his tray down if he wanted to because of this. Why didn't we pay for extra leg room you ask? Well because we have not had this problem on any other flight we have flown. Then on the way back from Paris I was able to add luggage to our reservation but again, like most airlines, we expected the weight limit to be 23kg per bag. No. It was only 20kg so we had to pull things out of our suitcase to get the weight down. Additionally,the lady checking us in was very rude and was talking about us in French with a very unpleasant look on her face. I am not fluent in French but body language says more than words. The check in attendant also first said that it would cost 10$ per kg over 20 and then after we took some things out she said it was 15$ because we needed to go to Chicago. Well of coarse we needed our bags to go all the way home. I also would  point out that whether our bags were under the plane or in the cabin, there is still the same amount of weight on the plane. Making us open all our luggage to save money in the airport is ridiculous. We were already frustrated and her changing information and being very rude and unprofessional did not help matters. We ended up paying $400 to get our luggage back on top of the $300 that we payed on the way there. This is the price of an extra airline ticket. This being said, we could have flown with ANY other airline and not have dealt with all the inconveniences. We are very upset with our flight experience on this trip.

This is not a complaint about the lack of free meals or in-flight entertainment.

We booked our WOW air flights months in advance of our flight measured our bags, which fit perfectly within the very restrictive WOW measurements. We have photographs to prove that the bags fit into the bags measurement frame placed at WOW gates. Prior to our flight we checked in online and received boarding passes into email, that was not a problem. However, at the gate of our flight from AMS to KEF we were stopped impolitely by an individual from WOW ground personnel, who started insisting that our bags were carry-ons just because they had 2 wheels, and that we had to pay in order to get them on the plane. She would not even look at my original ticket, where the definition of included luggage only showed dimensions and had in no way specified that included luggage could not have wheels. She never measured the bags, nor weighed them, nothing, just insisted that ""wheels"" cannot be placed under seats due to ""safety."" This individual further refused to provide her name and also prohibited me from taking a photo of her ID for evidence, repeating multiple times that it is not allowed. Every question I tried to ask she dismissed with It is not allowed, to the point that I felt I was talking to a robot. I tried to show her the original ticket on my phone, but she refused to have any human communication or reasoning with me, and kept repeating it is not allowed. When I asked to see a supervisor, she replied, it is not allowed to have a supervisor, after which she moved us to the side and said we were not getting on the flight at all. We had to wait until the entire plane was boarded, when she sent a colleague of hers, who likewise insisted that our small bags were trolleys and were not allowed on the flight for free due to safety. I tried to explain that my original ticket showed no such prohibition whatsoever, but she insisted we had to pay or we could not fly. We absolutely felt blackmailed, humiliated and ended up profoundly disturbed They charged us 160 Euro for our two bags, as we were taking a connect flight to Detroit later that afternoon from Reykjavik, and only then were we allowed to board the flight. Once we paid, however, we were told that we could place our bags wherever we chose, and when I said that the entire affair was not about safety but about paying, they had no response, because this is what it was all about – extorting money from travelers.

At least 30 mins late, but my last plane was 2 hours late. The flights are quite stable in being late, so usually being late for the same time. Eat just before flight and buy a bottle of water just before flight. Usually you can do this in airport just before flight, but if late-evening flight (after 22:00), then it make sense to eat before entering airport. 3. Come to Wow air registration anyway (even if you printed boarding passes in advance), so they would print new boarding passes for you. This can prevent some issues. Do not rely on anything to be on-time. For example, I bought 12:30 Gold Ring tour on plane (being sure that flight arrives at 11:00 and then enough time to be at 12:30 to BSI-terminal for taking this tour), but actually plane arrived at 11:12AM and then bus arrived at 12:34, so I was 4 mins late for the tour (and I've seen the tour bus going away trying wave my hands to driver, but it didn't help). As result, lost the 60USD ticket for tour and didn't see Gold Ring that I wanted during flight connections. Better to take rent-car after the flight (because even if flight 2 hours late, you could still take rent car, but this doesn't apply to buses or even could be worse if next-connection-other-companies-flight). This is not about Wow air, but just about Keflavik airport flight-connections during night. During my way back, I had a night in airport. I didn't reserve any hotel. I had a boarding pass in advance and did some walking in Reykjavik during day-time (latest Flybus from BSI-terminal to airport at 20:00), so first I did some walking around outside airport during the evening and then entered at 23:30 the boarding zone without any problems. Then slept about from 00:15 to 4:30. The border (for zone D) closed during night hours, but still if having boarding pass, then can sleep somewhere in zone C just before border. There are no special places to sleep, but if you can sleep both sitting, then it is Ok. The good news that Wow air not so strict on baggage size. The limit is 42x32x25cm for free of charge baggage item, but during my flight back I used school bag with exactly these sizes (and with much inside it could be even 43x33x30cm), and this still was Ok.

,WOW air,Economy Class,August 2018,18th August 2018,1,1,1,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"Los Angeles to Reykjavik. The only reason I considered this airline is because it was the only direct flight and they had ""big seats,"" that we could upgrade to so I thought why not. We paid a lot extra to get the biggest seats, plus bags, meals etc. Well, the night before the flight, we check in and they have put us in standard seats with no extra legroom. They have four types of seats and they put us in the very smallest despite us paying several hundred dollars more per ticket for bigger seats. So, I call the customer service line and they just tell me that I will have to file a claim when I get back! So, my husband calls and they move our seats to what they say are bigger seats. Guess what? They were standard seats on the seat map. So, at that gate they start selling our seats that we already paid for as upgrades! So, my husband goes up and tries to find out why they are selling seats we already paid for and they just offer him some other seats that are supposedly XL but they are in the back of the plane. He says, we don't want seats that don't recline. They say they do recline. So, he agrees and they try to charge him again for an upgrade! Guess what? They are regular standard seats and they don't recline and for extra good measure the plug between the seats doesn't work on either row of seats that they put us in. This was on an overnight flight with my 8-year-old daughter. So, it comes to our return flight - same scenario. They put us in regular standard seats. We called the night before and my husband paid for another upgrade even though we already purchased their highest tier because he doesn't want to argue with them, we just wanted better seats. So, they move our seats, but when we get to the airport, they put us back in the regular standard seats! So, we spent the entire 3 hours at the airport trying to get better seats by talking to 3 different service desks, to no avail. We tell the crew when we get on the plane in case they have any extra decent seats and they offer us one free water. Plugs don't work on this flight either. Every single person we dealt with told us our seats were XL until I showed them the seat map and they will charge you for upgrades in seats that aren't upgrades at all. Everyone just said you'll have to file a claim. Guess what. When I filed a claim when we got back, they declined it and said that we had to contact customer service. Customer Service claimed that they don't deal with refunds. His message told me that I would have to go through an airline rights group. So, they basically tried to steal our money and make it as difficult as possible to get some of our money back. We never got our meals that we paid for or our seats. You are taking a huge risk flying this airline because even if they cancel your flight, you might not get your money back based on their customer service practices of denying legitimate claims.

Being the first to book WOW Premium on our travel dates, we did not expect three family members to be bumped down two classes of service – from Premium to Basic – and the other two members to be bumped from Premium to Plus. But, that’s what happened two days before departure. How do I know we booked first? Because the seat schematic in premium class was completely empty when we bought tickets 8 months before departure and selected our seats. Plane change was given as the reason, but the real reason was that WOW reconfigured their seats and classes of service, and didn’t notify anyone – at least not us. So instead of re-assigning seats according to booking dates or giving you the option of selecting new seats based on an early-booking priority, we were evidently randomly selected to downgrade even though we would have re-booked different dates had we been given more than 48-hours’ notice. The same thing happened on the way home. We were again bumped to lower service levels. On the way to Iceland, we at least received a few of the Premium perks, including a “meal” that consisted of a 10-inch baguette with two deli-thin slices of ham. But, this time, we were asked to show our receipts to the flight attendants in order to receive the meal and two drinks – one hot and one cold. Yes, that’s right, one hot and one cold. And we were informed that if we wanted two cold drinks we would have to pay for one, even if we were to forego the hot drink. Our luggage arrived with us on the flight to Iceland. It also made it home, which we were happy to discover after a suspenseful, 40-minute wait at St. Louis’ baggage claim. Others weren’t so lucky. At least a half-dozen passengers mentioned that their luggage had been lost. Some on a non-stop flight others on a connection through Reykjavik to and from Europe. One individual was on his way home after two weeks in Europe he still hadn’t received his suitcase. Another person mentioned that her luggage never made it onboard the non-stop flight to Iceland. Then, when it did arrive, WOW refused to deliver the bags. They kept them at the airport until her week-long tour returned for the trip back to the States. Fly WOW if cost-savings are paramount and you’re willing to chance the service for the savings. Seats are really small, unless you upgrade.

I normally do not write bad reviews, but I feel obligated to let others know about the trap that I fell into. If you’re planning on flying with this airline, please consider reading my experience and the lesson that I learned. I will certainly never fly with WOW air again. To summarize it, WOW delayed our flight nearly 8 hours causing us and everyone on our plane to miss our connections in Iceland. It was said that we were delayed because ""technical difficulties that led to overbooking"". We got to the Dallas airport more than 4 hours before the scheduled flight, but ended up waiting in a line of several hundred people for almost 6 hours before the WOW staff even bothered to show up at their check in desk. Apparently, there were about 3 plane-loads of people, and only 1 small plane, so they made a randomized list of who was going to get to fly that day, and we were ""lucky"" enough to be on it. Eventually, about 8 hours after the flight had ben scheduled to leave, we finally boarded the plane. Everyone on the plane had connections to somewhere in Europe, and it was pretty obvious that all of us would be missing those connections being so late. We were all worried and asked about what would happen. We were told that we would be ""taken care of"" once we got to Iceland, but instead, no one was there. Not a single WOW employee was in the airport who could help us. They did absolutely nothing to help anyone, basically stranding all of us in Iceland. Everything through WOW was booked for days, and we waited in lines for hours hoping for help, but eventually we had to book another flight ourselves through a different airline to get out of Iceland, costing me more than $1300 just to get to a destination I had already paid to get to through WOW. They had absolutely zero concern for helping anyone and basically canceled our flight after bringing us half way and into a foreign county. It was a horrible experience, and even though I was told I would receive a refund for the flight that they did not provide, I have still not received it more than 2 weeks later. Although I was lucky enough to get out of Iceland that day, I believe that most people did not. I remember leaving the line at the unhelpful service desk to look for other flights and seeing a line of a couple hundred people, including families and small children, sitting on the concrete floor waiting and hoping for Wow air to do something. I don’t have a problem with cheap airlines and I understand that sometimes unforeseeable things happen that cause problems and delays. But the way that a company handles problems matters. I have flown many times with many different airlines, and I have never had an experience as terrible as this one. If you have a week to spare, no plans made ahead of time, a lot of extra cash, and you don’t mind being stuck in an airport for days at a time, then go ahead - book a flight with Wow.

They also changed to gate twice on me at the airport and did not inform anyone. Luckily, I went to the information desk to find out what was going on since it was boarding time. The flights attendants are not pleasant, they look at you like something is wrong with you. All four flights with Wow the attendant were all the same. Unless your traveling very light, like only a book bag, then maybe book with them. Other than that, they even charge for carry ons. When I was buying my luggage, which was $75 each way, I remember a carry on being $54 each way. They even check how big your back bag is though and if it doesn’t fit in this little metal thing they have they will charge you. I seriously do not recommend. I could have spent $700 on another flight and had everything included. This trip cost me much more than I wanted it to because no one wants to spend 19 hr in an airport so I rented a car to travel around. For 1 day it was $150 and gas to fill up a smart car which was just under half a tank was $50. Food is also overpriced in Iceland as well.

We were informed our flight would be delayed by five hours and we would miss our connecting flight but that we would be booked on the next flight out. When we got to Reykjavik, I think half of the travelers about 200 people had missed their connecting flights. We were routed to one line, all of us, and were told one by one that we were told to go to another line where we would be told our new connecting flights. We were told to go pick up our baggage and then go to another line to be told of our connecting flight. This took us until three hours later. They told us we were booked on the 6am flight and to be outside the hotel at 3:30 in the morning. While were were sleeping they sent us another email that we were now booked art 12 o’clock flight which was already delayed an hour, but we were to be ready at 9am for pick up. So loss of valuable vacation time and sleep! We could not even go to the town because of their ineptitude at the airport, plus they did not have sufficient staff to service all of the delayed people. While in one of the lines next to us was another line of people from a different wow flight waiting to find out their destiny. With the significant amount of delayed flights they have, wow should have this down to a science, but instead they are bumbling buffoons.

The worst part is that I met many other stranded people who had wasted 14 hours because of the complete lack of organization of this slapstick sideshow that calls itself Wow Air. My suggestion on future improvement for WOW air is that they halt all expenses towards their peddling ridiculous pink gaudy outfits for their attendants and redirect their time, money, and energy towards getting their customers to their destinations on time.

We get there and check in is closed. Then, because of the delay, we miss our connecting flight and need to spend a night in Iceland, without our luggage (because they lost it and were unable to tell us where it might be/when we would get it). At least WOW Air paid for everyone's hotel and food, as Iceland is expensive. Then, the next day, we try to board our flight home, and multiple peoples' tickets are denied. They assigned seats to multiple people. A line of about 50 was waiting for this to be resolved. Then, the plane leaves an hour later than scheduled after the confusion.

My connection from Edinburgh was a bit late arriving to Stansted and the bags took   longer than expected. I arrived to the check in counter with around an hour before my flight was departing. The first thing I saw when I got to the check in counter was a woman was being denied on the flight to Iceland, the flight I was getting on.  The woman behind the counter could care less.

,WOW air,Economy Class,May 2018,2nd June 2018,0,0,1,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"Amsterdam to Newark via Keflavik. I had a nightmarish trip home with WOW this week. As is common with budget airlines, you get a low fare, but must pay extra for food, drinks, a comfortable seat, etc., and the fees for checked bags are high. Fair enough, customers know this going into the purchase, and for many it might be a good choice. Our trip to Amsterdam via Reykjavik went smoothly, and I have no complaints at all. We carried our own food on to the flight, and paid to check our bags. But the trip home was awful, and explains to me why WOW has such a poor reputation. First, we were delayed five hours in Amsterdam. The first hour delay was due to weather, but the rest of it really did seem to be the airline's fault. We sat on the tarmac in a packed plane for almost 5 hours, and air conditioning was run only briefly a couple of times during those hours. The heat was extreme. The crew served beverages (for payment) only once, early on given the heat and the delay, offering water for free would have been the humane thing to do. The children and elderly passengers suffered the most, I think. Due to the delay, everyone missed their connecting flights. The one service person left on duty to help about 150 passengers with connecting flights did her best, and we were put on a later flight to Newark. But not ONE of the passengers from Amsterdam who were rerouted to the Newark flight got their luggage. The three hours that we had in Reykjavik apparently were not enough to transfer any of our bags. Today, the luggage desk explained their very unusual way of handling delayed luggage. All American passengers' luggage is sent to Boston and then handed off to Fed Ex., and you won't get it for 3-5 working days after it is given to FedEx That will add up to a week for me, since the weekend will intervene. And I'll have to take another day off from work to wait for delivery. No one packs a week's worth of medications and toiletries (or clothes) in the carry on, since no one would anticipate such a long delay. So WOW charges high luggage fees, but has much slower and poorer delivery. It's not worth the savings.

During purchase, the schedule indicated that my flight would be on the 19th May at ""00:50. I even checked with a representative that the flight was on the 19th when I quizzed here about getting there 3 hours before (for security processing). So according to the representative, that would mean the evening of the 19th. Imagine my surprise to receive this message: ""Dear WOW air guest on flight WW122 DTW-KEF 19MAY18. This is a friendly reminder about your flight timings since it’s our experience that a departure time shortly after midnight tends to cause confusion. The departure time of your flight is shortly after midnight 00:50 and the check-in closes before midnight the day before the scheduled departure day, at 23:50. Have a WOW flight! Kind regards WOW air."" This shows that they know about the confusion that their after midnight flights cause! When I received the message, I checked with the airline again, only to find that my flight was on 18th May in the evening (if I get there 3 hours before the flight). This conversation was difficult since it took the representative a while to understand the concept of arriving a few hours before the flight, and consequently had to check. I was then told the bad news that my flight was actually on the 18th May. In my opinion this is a very dishonest way of dong business! I had booked my hotel up until the 19th May, and it was really luck that I checked my messages, otherwise I would have missed my flight and probably would have been fleeced for a reschedule! Do WoW Air do this deliberately? I  suggested to WoW Air to use the 24 hour clock system (incorporating the 24 to 25 hour indication) to avoid the confusion. For example, my flight schedule should have actually read: 18th May, at 24:50hrs. They told me that this was under consideration, but because complaints are currently not processed by the Aviation Authority regarding dishonest trading, I am doubtful that they will.

My girlfriend and I were a little skeptical about flying this airline after reading all of the negative reviews, but after our round trip vacation from Toronto to Iceland and back, we had no idea why this airline had so many negative reviews! Maybe our standards for a good flight were low, but if it weren't for all of the pink, we couldn't tell the difference between this and a Delta flight. My recommendation is to just know what you're getting into before you leave and you will not have any problems. There isn't any complementary food or beverage service, solution? Eat before you leave and buy a drink at the airport before the flight. Our luggage got their fine and in great shape. I have read a lot of negative reviews about how WOW lost passengers luggage - it's not their fault! The airport handles the luggage, not the airline! So stop giving WOW a hard time over this issue if it happens to you. Another negative review I have seen is people complaining about the airline switching their seats around - we booked our flight 4 months in advance and chose seats and those were the ones we were given. We also got to the airport 2.5 hours before our flight (like you should for an international flight) and were able to check in perfectly. More negative reviews I saw were about how they don't give you your boarding pass if you spell your name wrong when you book - how is this different from any other airline? Even if you somehow spell your own name wrong at the time of booking, I believe you can alter it up to 24 hours before your flight - WOW even sends you a reminder email (and text if you sign up for it) to make sure you have spelled your name right and have all of the necessary documents to travel to the country you are going. In conclusion - for 900 dollars total, my girlfriend and I got a round trip flight from Toronto to Iceland with 3 checked bags (we camped and brought our stuff so we had to have a additional bag for that stuff). The next cheapest option was going to be around 1400 for the two of us. We had a great experience on this airline and were surprised how great it was after reading all of the negative reviews before hand. The seats were fine and they actually had more legroom then some of the domestic US flights I have taken.

On the 29th April they didn't allow me to get onto my flight. I booked this flight with three months advance. It was my first time traveling with Wow Airline and I was pretty excited with this trip because I was doing a stopover in Iceland and I have planned to visit the Blue Lagoon, so I reserved and paid in advance to get in, as I only had around 8hrs in land. As a frequent traveller you can imagine my surprise when I was doing the checkin at 5pm at Montreal airport and the ground crew told me that WoW airline will not aloud me to travel because in my reservation there was only my first and my surname, missing my middle name. As a frequent traveller, I take care of all my reservations and I always use the same information, my first and my last name. Apart of that I also provide my passport number and the expiring date. So the person that have booked this trip could only be me, no one else had the same data. I tried to talk and explain my situation to the gentleman at the airport and he told me that he couldn't help me so I asked to speak with his supervisor, Anne Marie. The ground crew supervisor told me that I couldn't travel for the same reason. I have tried to find different solutions but I guess she wasn't patient enough to help me with that. After 4min conversation she told me to speak with the customer service supervisor by phone. I was really frustrated to understand that no one took responsibility for the problem and no one could or wanted to help me. Once again, I follow her instructions and I called the customer service supervisor. I explained my situation and I asked for help finding out a solution. I have suggested a lot of thinks like paying for adding my middle name on the reservation, paying a fee to enter at the flight. But his answer was the same as everyone else, he couldn't help me and he is following rules and the airline policies. All this situation was really frustrating and it also shows us (the passengers) that you don't invest the enough time/money in your customer service. During the three times i have speak with people that work for your Wow Air, no one ever provide me a solution or tried to help me. Everyone just told me that I will have to buy a new ticket for the day after and wait at the airport. After all I find out they always do that when their flight is overbooked.

I was aware of the extra charges many reviewers have commented on in their reviews. Therefore, when booking I could clearly see the true cost and was aware of additional fees. For two people (My wife and I) we paid €750 for a one way ticket from San Francisco to Dublin with a short stopover in Reykjavik. This included check in luggage up to 20Kg, carry on luggage (10 Kg) and a personal item (rucksack, handbag). This was more than sufficient and the extra fees paid for this luggage allocation are included in the €750. The flight from SFO- Reykjavík was on the Airbus A330 aircraft with a flight time of 8 hrs. Although the leg room was tight, it was by no means uncomfortable, once you took a regular stretch or walk as you should do on any airline. Limited food menu was available onboard. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The one negative was that the universal charge points beneath the seat were not working, however, the staff obliged by charging in their rest area. After a short stopover in Reykjavik we boarded a new Airbus A321 to Dublin and this plane had all the modern comforts of a brand new aircraft. Although we had to pay for food onboard both flights, the difference between travelling with Wow and Aer Lingus was saving in the region of €800 for two people with the stopover adding 2.5-3hrs to the journey.

We flew on a XXL (BIZ-Class) ticket from Baltimore to Frankfurt and back and had a very pleasant experience. WoW Air operates one of the newest aircraft fleets and all four planes we flew with were 2016 or 2017 build. Our ticket included priority boarding, seat selection, free luggage, free meal and drink. Nothing to complain about. Staff on the plane was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Now, here seems to be the trick: We did a little research and talked to folks who had flown WoW Air before and got some insights. Make sure you adhere to their luggage requirements. Understand that an XXL seat is a seat of the exact same size as any other seat, but it's in the exit row and gives you the additional leg room. There was mention, however in the magazine that the airline has started to add ""real"" Business Class seats to their Airbus 300 planes and plans the same upgrades, with confirmed seating option, to their 321/320 fleet. Know that you do not have in-board entertainment unless you bring your own I-Pad or pay 25$ to rent one. Understand that everything, from water to food, will cost you money. So the bottomline: If you pay only $126 on-way to Frankfurt and expect a 5-star service, you'd be thoroughly disappointed and write a review like the ones we read. If you pay about $400, you get the premium treatment and write a review like this. One thing I can't comment on, is how their service develops once something goes wrong, like many reviewers experienced. We may just have been lucky that everything went well.",Baltimore to Frankfurt via Keflavik,2,4,wow-air,a very pleasant experience,Business,Trip Verified,5,0,d2650b25-8d6d-4ec6-86fa-c2b7810d9a60

On the way back, we arrived in Schiphol Airport. We lined up to give our luggage and the person helping us informed us that our flight has been cancelled. She could not give a reason for this. We soon after received an email detailing this cancellation. It said it was cancelled due to ""operational restrictions"". We inquired and it was never made clear to us the reason for this. Either way, alright. Flight is cancelled lets check our options. WOW Air gave us an option of either getting a full refund on our flight, no refund but next available flight (which was in 4 days. I had a huge backpack and they were not willing to make hotel accommodations), or to later file for compensation. My girlfriend decided to opt for a full refund. Fair. She got her money back. I opted to file for compensation. In this case, we had to get back to Toronto in 2 days maximum. We then found the next available flight out. It cost us both around 900$ CAD each. Around $1800 total. So at this point she's out $500 and I am out the full $900. I then wanted to file for compensation. Here we are 8 months later. After waiting and waiting and waiting we were promised $1200 CAD compensation. I said great. That is perfect. However, last second I got an email informing me that the airline did not want to pay such a price and slashed it in half. Now we are only getting $600 CAD which will not come close to even covering my ticket home not to mention the discomfort of sleeping in an airport chair for 2 nights. I am now in the process of inquiring about this. I called a representative who was nice but basically couldn't do a thing but tell me he would speak with his supervisor. Not too confident on the outcome here. If you ever have the idea that WOW is cheaper and you want to save a buck keep in mind there is a good chance you will have to pay much more if anything goes wrong. This is not the only story out there like this. Also, I spoke with my dad who mentioned airlines sometimes cancel flights if they cannot fill the plane.

Extra complaints - no options for a free snack like peanuts or even water the flight attendants are rude and made guests feel uncomfortable. Missed our connecting flight to LGW.

Our bus voucher could not get us on a bus - the bus drivers said ""no, you go that bus over there"" (broken English) - eventually there were no more bus options. We went inside, wandered for a good bit until we finally found a WOW employee, who told us to go outside (into the blizzard, I'll add) to look for the bus that originally told us we could not get on! After much arguing, WOW put us on a taxi to our hotel that was 45 minutes from the airport. The hotel was not ready for us and we waited, sleep-deprived in the lobby for two hours. The food voucher could only afford us bowls of soup from a restaurant that was not friendly. We were told to meet in our hotel lobby at 2:30AM and a bus would pick us up. The bus never came. Time was cutting close, so we opted to call a taxi to take us to the airport, or else we would miss our flight. The taxi ride costed us $200. There was no WOW air gates, so there was no representatives available to talk to. We stood in a random line in the middle of the airport which was our ""gate"".

I was impressed with the crew who addressed the situation calmly and professionally and was able to assure the disgruntled passenger that he was safe.

The stop ended up taking 2 hours, and then we had a 2 hour flight to Iceland. By the time we arrived, we had been on aircraft #1 for 12 HOURS. (My kids were not delighted). We obviously missed our connecting flight, so we were put up at a hotel overnight, and told we'd be on the next flight to BWI the next day. We get to the airport the next day, only to be told we'd be flying first to Chicago, then to BWI. This is after travelling with kids for 36 hours. Our kids were falling apart, and we were too. We asked to be put onto an IcelandAir flight directly to Washington Dulles Airport. We knew that other WOW Air travelers with our exact itinerary were put on that flight. At this point, the WOW Air employees became extremely rude. Two employees deliberately hid their name tags after we politely asked for their names, one even yelled at my husband ""never to do that again!"". WOW Air employees lied to us, telling us that IcelandAir was no longer selling their tickets to WOW, and that the only way home was via a (WOW Air) flight to Chicago, then a (Spirit Air) flight to BWI. As this was all happening, I get a text message from WOW Air, telling me that my flight to Chicago was delayed. We ended up going to the IcelandAir desk and asking if they still had tickets on their flight to Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. that day (in 4 hours time). They said yes, and they were happy to sell them. We asked if they'd sell to WOW Air, and they said yes- but they were selling them at full price at this point (which obviously WOW didn't want to buy). After a lot of begging, pleading, and arguing with WOW Air employees, we told them we were just going to buy our own flight home, and then seek reimbursement and then some. One WOW Air employee agreed that this was the best thing to do. In the end, we spent over $1800 buying tickets on IcelandAir just to get home in the most straightforward, timely way possible.

I must express how ineffectual WOW Air have made my claim by responding to me 13 working days after the fact that is 19 days altogether. The result is that I was forced to, grudgingly, pay for additional flights at a greater cost to me and for fewer days on my trip. In the mean time, £190.46 of my money is out of my hands and I am struggling to reclaim it. I paid for WOW air's service on the 19th March, the funds were removed from my bank account but no error was brought to my attention by WOW air. I was not receiving an email with confirmation or a booking number. As my emailed inquiry yielded no response, I contacted WOW air's customer service line by phone, where I was told that no money had been received and the whole transaction had timed out. Where was my notification about this? No additional help was offered, certainly no offer of discount or priority to be seated on flights of similar dates. I simply had to purchase new flights. The last injury was to be charged an additional (approximately) £80 at the airport in Keflavik, moments before the flight as our hand luggage was assessed by WOW air's staff members and deemed to be far too large to be considered a carry on (it won't fit under the seat, therefore it must go in the overhead storage)- the difference being a matter of centimeters larger than the example cage available. We had no choice but to pay, or to abandon our luggage. An absolutely unreasonable policy, as the website states clearly that assigning luggage before the flight will cost much less than to do it at the airport, yet what is the justification for this price difference? The system is computerised, that's why we the customers are typing in all the information that WOW air needs to arrange flights, and the staff member that charged us this outrageous price (whilst apologising, stating it was the worst part of her job to enforce this) simply took our passport information and entered it into her computer. Was that typing what we paid for? We were blocked entry until we paid so I can only see that it was WOW air generating more labour for itself in this occasion. The perfect punchline to this experience was discovering that there was no more space in the overhead storage anyway. Our carry on bag that was apparently too big to fit under the seat, remained under the seat for the entire flight.

Incapable, uncaring, rude, unprofessional and overall, exhaustingly disappointing. I had purchased my ticket a month in advance, checked in 24hrs in advance (3rd person to check in) and I was denied boarding. First reason I was given by the ground staff ""Aircraft has been switched, the seat you were assigned does not exist on this plane."" I called WOW, on hold for 30 minutes, to be told that the exact same thing by the agent over the phone. They were offering to book me on the next WOW flight, which was two (2!) days later. I refused. Told I had to wait 60 minutes and follow up then. Spoke with another agent 60 minutes later (after being on hold for another 30 minutes), to be told I was denied because the flight was overbooked. Put on hold multiple times, for the call to be ""dropped"" and for me having to call again. The third phone agent I reached asked me for the same information, and then proceeded to tell me that the reason was because I had misspelled my middle name on the boarding ticket. I do not have a middle name. They were grasping at straws trying to find an excuse. I emailed my passport information to them as well as the boarding pass so that the agent could review it. After 1.5 hours I was finally told I was denied because it was overbooked. No fault of my own, next flight was in 2 days, I could be booked on that. I refused and wanted a refund, as well as WOW covering my hotel charge due in Brussels. ""We are not able to refund you sir"". Overall, absolutely horrible experience.

,WOW air,Economy Class,December 2017,13th April 2018,2,1,2,Canada,4.0,no,"Toronto to Amsterdam via Keflavik. Although I didn't have the worst experience with this airline, I was still quite unhappy with it. I know that airlines are now moving towards charging for carry-ons and bags separately, but the costs with WOW are absurd. I cannot say for certain, but it also looks like their carry-on measurements are below the average so be aware of this. They will measure your bag, and if it is over, they will not allow you to bring it on and you will need to pay a hefty fee to check it in. We saw them reject several carry-ons. The seats on the flight were tiny, and they do not provide any refreshments on-board. Considering the flight from Toronto to Reykjavik is 5 hours, not providing passengers with even a glass of water or a soda is unreasonable, especially because you cannot bring liquids through the gate. Since you are stuck at the Reykjavik airport, this is your only option to purchase food and drinks where a sandwich alone will cost you 20CAD. Our flight home was also delayed, so you end up spending more time in the airport than you plan to. Their business model sounds good in theory, since they offer cheaper flights with flexibility on what exactly you want to pay for, but the experience is just not worth it. The hidden costs add up quicker than you think, and your ""cheap"" flight only ends up being 100-200 less than a non-budget airline. Just pay the extra money since 1) you won't have to worry about showing up to the airport with a carry-on not up to their standards 2) you'll receive at the very least water so you don't dehydrate on board 3) the plane will be larger and more comfortable 4) you'll land in a bigger and cheaper airport if you have a stopover, but we often find direct flights with comparable prices. We travel oversees at least 3 times a year, and this experience was definitely the most unpleasant and uncomfortable, and took us an entire week to recover. Bottom line: if you really want to save a few extra bucks or travel very short distances sure. But if you want a smoother, efficient, and positive experience, I recommend another airline.",Toronto to Amsterdam via Keflavik,2,3,wow-air,I recommend another airline,Couple Leisure,Trip Verified,2,0,b781b74b-5824-43f5-a82d-6bea075f1b9b

My son booked the the return tickets for me, himself and his 6 year old daughter about six weeks prior to the flight. We were going to visit my other son and his three children on spring break. In Ireland much to my horror we were refused entry to the flight because the name on my ticket was Gary C King and the name on my passport was Gary Charles King and my son had the same problem as the name on the ticket was Matthew Simon King and on the passport was Matthew King. On their web site is does not clearly state that the passport name must be used exactly on the ticket Had their system checked at any time prior to flight, they would have see the difference and could have and should have notified us to change the data. At the airport I pointed out that I had four pieces of picture ID, three government issued and my son had three. WOW's response, these do not count are we will not correct these tickets - call this number in Iceland. My son spent 1/2 hour on hold till he got an operator and another 3/4 hr trying to get Wow to correct the data. They refused and we thus missed the flight. We were not the only ones. A least 5 other people had the same problem and I presume some missed the flights. I was told from WOW'S staff in Montreal it is your problem not ours, Montreal never changes anything, if  Iceland want to it is their decision you should have read the fine print. Lastly when I asked to see the person in charge she at first refused to see me, and after insisting, she finally showed her face and said she could do nothing. She also as a parting comment stressed that we should have read the fine print and then pulled out a blow up of that data underlined in yellow to prove her point to us customer with this problem. Obviously WOW Is totally aware of this problem and does nothing to solve it. At no time did they offer to change the tickets to a later date and when I asked to go ""standby"" as at least our three seats were now open, they refused. So my conclusion is correct.

,WOW air,Economy Class,March 2018,3rd April 2018,0,0,3,UnitedStates,9.0,yes,"I bought my ticket from Paris to Toronto via Keflavik from Wow air and didn't expect much because the ticket was $250 whereas the second cheapest ticket was $850. I traveled light with just a small (12x10x17 inc) backpack so I didn't have to pay extra. If you need a carry-on luggage, you will need to pay extra around $30 (pay online will be cheaper than pay at the door). All of my flights were on time. I notice that Wow's flights between Iceland and European countries are often overbooked (might be because Wow air is a budget airline) so you might want to check in online (very convenient) to secure a seat well before you get to the airport. Again, the ticket is cheap so you will have to pay extra for many things (food, water, entertainment, booze) but you definitely don't have to pay extra for good attitude from the flight crew, as long as you are respectful to them. I sat next to a smelly passenger (got headache from it) and kindly asked a flight attendant to switch my seat and she promptly found another seat for me. When the flight was going through turbulence, the flight attendant sitting near me constantly tried to calm me down (I was scared and sobbing). These two events prompted me to believe that Wow air is a great budget airline and I will definitely fly with them again. Buy your food before your flight if you don't want to eat/pay for food on the flight. You can buy the water bottle on the flight or fill an empty bottle before boarding to save money. Since Wow air sells their ticket from different countries' website, you can buy the same ticket at a lower price if you have one of those travel credit card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fee. For example, I bought my ticket from the Canadian website which charges the ticket in Canadian dollars, which is cheaper (after currency conversion) than the same ticket bought in USD (from US website).",Paris to Toronto via Keflavik,3,5,wow-air,a great budget airline,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,5,0,68503a9c-87c9-4604-90d2-506dd24763aa

For the first time I have experienced flight crews that limit the use to passengers of the forward toilet. An absolute never-again moment for me. There was a gaggle of cabin attendants continuously in the front galley of this A330-200. They did their normal thing in the cabin and spent a lot of time eating and drinking and chatting behind closed curtains. Before take-off the lavatory lock was set to closed (normal procedure, lifting the tab and closing the lock) but I noticed that the red light in the cabin remained red for a long time, well into the cruise phase of the flight. I assumed that unlocking the lavatory was somehow forgotten so I got up to ask and go to the toilet. I was told by a cabin attendant that the lavatory was “inoperable”. Which is not a word a cabin attendant will voluntarily use. “Unserviceable” maybe, or “broken”. I got back to my seat and started paying attention to this. With no inflight entertainment I had plenty time to do this. And what happened? From time to time the lavatory occupied light in the cabin went from red to green, then back to red, and so on. The lavatory was being used. At the same time, every passenger who came forward to use the lavatory was told to go to the back. Each and every one. I’m actually really upset by this. The cabin attendant who told me that the lavatory was “inoperable” lied to my face. If for some reason WOW has a policy of limiting the use of the front lavatory for (flight) crew only, then so be it. But then be open about it and do not lie to me. After the flight I had the urge to wait for the captain to appear from his cockpit to congratulate him on having such a strong bladder because during the almost 8 hours that they have been in their seats, not once did I see either one of the flight crew making a trip to the back of the aircraft to make a lavatory visit. There was no need of course. They had their own “inoperable” lavatory. Else: Poor in-flight food / I find the meal choice a very slim one for a 7.5 hour flight. Also weird that on my first flight I was given 2 meals for both flights (“this is how we do things” said the cabin attendant on my first flight). Then on my second flight I was given another meal. Now I had three. Cabin on board not clean/comfortable / The cushion of my big seat was flat and loose. The big seats don’t have enough pitch, and I could not use my laptop when the passenger in front had his seat back in my lap. Poor service on board / My biggest gripe on these flights. While the WOW PA is not bad, certainly better than most I've listened to and funny at times even, the cabin crew really is not interested in the passengers, other than milking money. They spend as much time as is possible behind their closed curtains (front) unless a passenger needs something (which means buying something) and then it’s all smiles and “how can we help?”.

Then, I read all the mostly-negatives reviews. I decided that I knew what I was in for (no entertainment, no free meals or drinks, etc.) and decided the reviewers were probably just hard-to-please. I paid for the checked bag and carry-on. Turns out, we didn't need carry-ons, so that was a waste of money. Also paid for ""priority boarding"". Found out that meant you get to board a bus first that takes you half way across the airport to get on the plane. Not so bad in L.A., but when landing in Iceland at 4.00 am, in cold and blowing snow, one really doesn't want to wait at the top of a flight of stairs while a second bus is brought up to carry passengers to the terminal. And, it's annoying to see empty gates at which the ""real airlines"" get to park. Obviously, one of the ways WOW saves money is by not paying to use those jetways. The bus trips are a true annoyance. Flights not so bad (paid for a ""comfy"" seat in front, a must!) as long as you bring a sandwich and water. Flight crews not especially helpful or friendly. Found out that it's much cheaper to buy the food on board (which didn't look bad) rather than buy food in Iceland. $45 for 2 cheeseburgers in the terminal opposed to $11 for a meal on board.

Not a single offer with vegetable and/or meat. I checked the food reservation for my flight back already - only a pizza is selectable. That’s nothing to choose from.

Because the flight stopped over in Iceland, each trip took 2 flights so altogether, I was on four flights, and each flight was late. It seemed like they don't know what they're doing so everything took longer than normal. Due to cancelled flights (snow storm), the flight I was supposed to be on was already full so they bumped me to a later flight, that was one version from a WOW service agent. Another version was that they split the group into two flights using smaller airplanes with one departing as scheduled and the other departing one hour later and they put me on the later flight which I contested but they said they couldn't change that even though when everybody boarded, there were seats left on the earlier flight. They said that the names of passengers on each flight was fixed one hour before departure and these names cannot be changed. The flight I took was one hour late so in the end, I arrived 2 hours later than scheduled.

I only flew them because I had left my booking 'till the last minute and the fare was $780 USD versus $1200 on BA. But in nearly every aspect of the journey it was fine. You prepare yourself for flying an LCC by dressing super casual, bring your reading and a loaded Ipad, plus a pillow and of course food. Cocoon yourself and the journey does go by. One key suggestion is to pay the extra $100 each way and get seat selection in their ""XXL"" cabin which has 35"" of pitch vs 32"" on the left side which is just ""XL"" and the back 2/3 of the plane which is a cramped 30"" or even worse. With the exception of one nasty gate agent in KEF - who shouted to get everyone upstairs to board while the bridge was jammed and people tripping over the stalled escalator, all staff interactions were fine. The crews on all 4 segments were either good or great. Yes you pay for water, so bring your own bottle and fill it at the airport! Yes you pay $12 for two beer. The A321 has much wider seats than the 787 or the 10 abreast 777 so that made things more comfortable. However, be careful when booking as it appears only 4 of their 321 fleet have such a large XXL or XL cabin in the front. I would dread to be on one of their super high density A321s at 220 seats (these 4 have only 200 seats). The connection in KEF was too long in both directions but plenty of super expensive cafes and power outlets. Plus the cleanest toilets I have ever seen in the world, this is a great plus for a transit. My only complaint, and this is major, is that the seats had cushions that were squashed flat. They were so thin that it felt like you were sitting on a sliding metal pan. For God's sake WOW, put new seat cushions in. If it wasn't for that, I would have rated the experience an 8.

Their customer service is atrocious, their policies are purposely deceptive, and the entire experience was tantamount to theft. I was traveling from Los Angeles to Reykjavik. A week before flying I received an email stating that the flight on Jan 31 was ""seriously delayed"" and to call customer service to arrange a new date. A new date? That's called a cancellation! After spending 20 minutes waiting for their Indian call center to answer, the lady would only tell me the flight was delayed indefinitely, however, if I could book through Chicago at the same cost since there were no other flight options for me that same date (WOW has only one flight per day from LAX, and not each day) I could get myself to Chicago before their 4.50 pm departure with nominal effort on United since I couldn't change my vacation dates. I was told to file a claim via their website to have any consideration of refunding the difference between flying from LAX and Chicago, especially since they charged me an additional $12 to have an assigned seat. After several attempts to file a claim and arguing via Facebook with their customer service, they admitted that their website didn't have a claim service, so they sent me a link via email saying they would get back to me within 72 hours. It's now 11 days with no response. I get to Chicago, but their check-in is only open 3 hours prior to boarding. I try to check-in, but they refuse to check me because my passport name was different than what was on my ticket (Tim versus Timothy). They tell me to step aside to call customer service to have it corrected since the gate agents can't do anything. After waiting in line for 25 minutes, the guy spends another 15 minutes making me hold before telling me there is nothing he can do because their policy does not allow changes within 4 hours of boarding. So, if you have any type of issue, they can't help you since they open three hours before boarding. So, I'm left stranded in Chicago. The best part is that the flight was delayed 1.5 hours, so technically my change was within the four hour window, but they wouldn't help me. The good news is I found my way to Icelandair, and had a very pleasant experience because they had a flight that left at 6.40pm.

WOW did put us up in a basic hotel, but the hotel was not infant friendly (i.e. no pack and play!). As a result of these delays, I missed my business interview. To top it off, they broke our baby stroller. We reported the damage in Brussels upon arrival and filed a claim with WOW.

I was flying from my vacation in the US from Baltimore to Amsterdam with a stopover in Keflavik airport. We got on the airplane in Baltimore without any problem and never expected what was about to happen. After all passengers were on board the captain announced that they have hard time closing the luggage door of the aircraft. He said that it is not supposed to cause any serious delays. After waiting for one hour on board the captain made another announcement that the door is still stuck and they need to find some equipment with hot water to unfreeze it. In the end, we stayed for 3,5 hours on board waiting for them to fix the luggage door. Upon arrival to Keflavik, we were just told to go to the meeting point to receive further information as all flights to Europe by WOW air left without waiting for any passengers who flew from the US or Canada. We waited for 8 hours for any information to arrive without any support or assistance from WOW air. No food or drinks were served, no communication was done whatsoever. In the end, after 8 hours of waiting, all people who missed their European flights were told to fly to Brussels instead and take a bus to their final destination. When we got on the Brussels airplane, we were told two things. First, we will fly with a stopover in London. Second, we need to leave the airplane because UK is not in Shengen so we need to pass the passport control.

This flight has been cancelled last minute and the communication was super bad. They couldn't put me in another flight before January, 16th (at least!) so they offered me to change the arrival destination. I did it for Boston, thinking that they would take in charge the ticket from Boston to Chicago. They didn't. They provided me a hotel in Paris. I didn't need it so I let them know, thinking that the price of the hotel that they didn't have to pay could cover my plane ticket or at least, a night in Boston in case of a night stopover. Despite all these efforts, nothing is done to help me. I am now 4 days late on my agendas, and I have to pay for another unplanned ticket. Plus, since I didn’t know if the flight would be canceled or not, I have to buy a hotel night in Boston as well. The communication is really bad, slow, not effective, nor helpful and definitively not reassuring for their customers. Then, finally the flight arrived but not without any trouble either. The flight from Paris to Iceland has been delayed for more than a hour, I had less than 15min to change, go through the security check and arrive at the opposite part of the airport for the connexion. After a cancellation, you can’t even imagine the stress this late arrival has generated ! And obviously: no communication from WoW whatsoever. The personnel on board told us that we will have time to go to the plane no problem : I had to run like crazy and to beg a security agent to let me pass in priority. Is that “no problem” ?!

It's just absurd that they aren't willing to bend on such a small amount, but out of principal, I will not be giving them any more of my business.

You get the basics - flights, and you can bring your back-pack on board (it's weight is not even specified, only the dimensions). I have read hundreds of bad to terrible reviews on this airline, and I came to the conclusion that people don't realize what a low fare airline is. First of all, I have to praise the ground services staff, working at the check in for WOW, as I have witnessed both in Miami and Berlin, how offensive and rude the travelers are, pushing the staff to let them bring an over-sized (by WOW standards) bag on board free of charge. The logic behind this is: If you have to be in Miami for a conference on Friday, you would probably not risk on taking the WOW air on Thursday, as they only fly twice per week. This means if there is a mechanical problem with the plane and they cancel the flight, they are not going to reroute you, and you are going to miss the conference. WOW will offer you a refund, or travel after 3-4 days, IF there is space. To make it on time, you have to pay more and pick the ""classic"" airlines, which are part of the alliances and can take you to your final destination on time. Having purchased the tickets, and having read all the terrible reviews, I have been following on WOW flights stats for flights from Reikjavik, and saw that in average, they only cancel one of their flights out of a hundred. Of course, the people who complain are always those who were on a cancelled flight. That said - if you want to travel cheap and don't care if, in worst case scenario, your travel dates will be switched by few days, take WOW.

For a few years, they offered the cheapest flights from the DC area to London. You had to deal with 1. No free food/drink (not even water) 2. A short stopover in Iceland (I actually prefer this) 3. Extreme limitation on carry-on, and big fees if you do not comply. I learned to bring water/food the hard way, I learned to bring a small bag the hard way. These are in your control as an inmate on WOW air. Unfortunately, not much else is. On my 3rd or 4th (and last) flight, the bag I always took for free suddenly no longer qualified. This was a surprise to me, and as there was a big checkin line behind me, I kind of panicked and paid the fee of 50+ pounds that brought the total cost above competitors (WOW has been getting less competitive, and is no longer always the cheapest option, even without extra fees). Before boarding, I consolidated my luggage, rechecked in and was told I could be refunded via the website. The only contact on the website is an email. They were quick to respond to my email, but just with a cookie-cutter 'we do not offer refunds' - depite what I was told. I re-explained the situation and soon they just stopped replying. There is no phone number on the website, I later got it on my return journey when checkin attendant opened a safe, and ripped off a number from a sheet with the number written on it like 50 times - like some kind of interest flyer. I called them and the phone operator was just as impossible to deal with - no refunds, despite the fact that I rechecked in and was told I could get one. At the end, he told me to have a 'wow day.'

I had found out that my passport was expiring the night before my trip, so I had to get an emergency passport the day of my flight. I had a legal name change so I wasn't sure what name the passport office was going to issue me (since I didn't have my original legal name change document with me in Montreal). But I called WOW the night before my flight asking if I could change my name on my ticket and the lady informed me I could, within the next hour. I didn't change it that night because I didn't know what name was going to be on my passport so I had to wait until I heard what the passport office said. By some miracle, I ended up getting a brand new passport in 7 hours and when I called WOW again at 2.30pm (my flight was at 6pm) they informed me with new information that I couldn't make any changes to my flight within 4 hours of departure. Essentially, WOW airline's call centre is very inconsistent and had provided me false information that first time I called. I wasn't restricted to 1 hour, I realistically had up to 4 hours before my departure. Because of that misleading information, I was unaware of that time constraint and thus prevented me from changing my name and the airline crew denying me access. On top of that, the airline crew treated me with such disrespect, rudeness, no empathy and showed no effort of trying to help me find a solution. Basically they were blaming me for everything. Especially the supervisor. I had called the call centre numerous times to try and get any compensation, even if it was just to get on the next available flight, which is a reasonable request as other airlines would try to put their customers on next available flights even if you missed the flight due to something like lateness. I am shocked  by the customer service this company gives. They don't care about you as a person and show no sympathy whatsoever. The customer care reps are trained to say the same line over and over again like robots, it's like you are talking to a brick wall.

I find out later that this is not true - as they mention how other options would be mentioned to me if the airline was at fault. This proves that they have options and the authority to do something but they just don't want to. All this company does is lie to you so they don't have to pay anything.

To begin with, I paid $600 CA for a ticket to London. Not a bad price. But, then only a small carry on is allowed, no regular size carry on. Luggage is extra and it is charged per leg. So, if you are heading from Canada westerly, it means 2 legs, one stop in Iceland and then on to London. That's about $80 if you decide to bring a small roller luggage. Then, when you reserve your seat, closer to departure, there is a charge (varied) for all seats, depending on where you want to sit. Again, per leg. So, that added up to another $60, for the cheapest seats possible. They will not even provide you with a drink of water on their flights. A water bottle is $5.

It's only for people like me- who often don't know when we need to return and thus can't book a return flight-- that it can work out in our favor to not lose money by missing a flight. My last trip, however, will stop me from purchasing a ticket from this airline in the future. Every time I fly, I use the last part of my hyphenated name, and I've never had issues. I do it because it's such an extremely long name that it generally doesn't fit, and I do it because it's so automatic now I don't use my hyphenated name for anything other than legal documents and even then it's so rare. Wow air had never said anything. But last time, on a day when I had a ultrasound for potential breast cancer and was horribly sick with the flu, they barred me from my flight because my name didn't fully match my passport. I apologized and said it was an oversight on my part and asked them to change it.

But if you're flexible on your travel and getting serious savings (in my case the ticket - even after the 140C$ paid for the bigger carry on bags was 488.21 C$ round trip - around 381 USD or 327 Euros), Wow air might be worth for you.",Montreal to Berlin via Keflavik,3,5,wow-air,"really good experience"" ",Solo Leisure,,5,0,5a5f30be-6ced-404f-a6fe-11c08a0acc4f

This October, my flight from Berlin to Toronto via Keflavik (KEF) arrived at KEF late. Originally, there was a 65 minutes time period to make it to the next flight. Passengers were not allowed to disembark the airplane for an additional 15 minutes. Upon arriving at the arrival terminal (25 minutes behind the schedule), the direction signs advised that there is a 20 minute walk to the departure gate at terminal D. In addition, we had to go through a passport check line and a security check. Somehow, I did manage to make it to the departure gate in 25 minutes (20 minutes before departure time), only to find that the gate was closed! Not my first missed connection, so I kept calm. Knowing that the airline was at fault, I prepared myself for the inconvenience of a later flight and/or even an unwanted night in Reykjavik. Upon asking for directions to WOW's customer service desk, I was advised that WOW air does not have a customer service desk at KEF (its main hub!). Only a local phone number. I called and I spent 20 minutes listening to elevator music until my phone ran out of charge. All other WOW employees that I approached after that, rudely refused to even talk to me. Frustrated, I approached other WOW employees who were checking-in other flights and firmly demanded an answer. After a short phone call (presumably, to the secret location of their ""customer service""), I was told (in a very rude tone) that WOW air only allows 30 minutes from the time of touchdown (and not actual disembarkment) for connecting passengers to arrive at their departure gate. This is notwithstanding of any delays on their airline's part, distance between terminals etc.. Therefore, I was told, the airline denies any responsibility with respect to my situation. With that she waved her hand in my face, ordering me not to utter any words and walked away as fast as she could. I was forced to purchase a ticket for Toronto from Icelandair at a full price of $1070CAD. During my one hour wait for my next flight at KEF, more than once I was told by the airport staff that I am not the first WOW passenger with that kind of experience! All of this could have been a run-of-the-mill missed connection story, and I would have put it behind me, if it wasn’t for WOW’s abhorrent, deliberately condescending and accusatory (obviously rehearsed) mistreatment of their passengers. Based on my online research after my return to Toronto and reading very similar experiences from other abused passengers, I have come to believe that my experience was not unique or a fluke, but this is part of a deliberate business model.

After waiting for 40 minutes on the phone and around 1.5 hours to get my baggage back, WOW offered me to get me on another flight almost a week later (what a joke)!

,WOW air,Economy Class,August 2017,17th August 2017,0,0,1,France,1.0,no,"Has anyone else experienced something similar with WOW air? Obvious answer: Yes! I had booked a return trip with this company to go visit my family in Canada. I was supposed to depart 13 August and arrive in Toronto on the same day at 17:30. At the airport I discovered that the flight was delayed, and then cancelled. Strangely - as is the case when flying with other airlines such as Lufthansa, Delta, Air Canada, etc. where one is assisted in person at the airport - none of their airport personnel was able to assist us passengers with rerouting our journeys and we were told to call their customer service numbers. This was unproductive I spent more than an hour and a half listening to elevator music and their automated message about how busy their super helpful customer service representatives were. But their customer service representatives weren’t helpful at all. As I was unable to contact anyone over the phone, I sent in my information via email and got a new itinerary for 18 August. How this is a “solution” to a flight cancellation on 13 August beats me! There were other, more indirect flights available with WOW air (which I found on my own, so perhaps they should hire me as a customer service representative since I’m doing their job for them) that the customer service told me I had to pay extra for. This is the same CDG-KEF-YYZ route, but with an overnight stopover in Reykjavik - so why I’d be expected to give another cent of my money to a company who hasn’t delivered on the initial service I paid for is baffling. I was also told that I should sort my own accommodations for the extra nights that I’m stranded here in Paris. What “wonderful” customer service. Another example of WOW air’s “wonderful” customer service is when at the airport a customer service representative told a customer who was trying to arrange speedy boarding for her son who has some sort of disability that she was “crazy” (she was understandable irate because whoever she was dealing with was so unhelpful/rude) and “to go away - I don’t want to see you anymore”. This is unacceptable treatment of a customer, especially someone requiring special services. It’s almost ironic that a company that named itself “WOW” because it’s “a universal positive saying” and because they “believe it captures the best that [they] stand for and also what Iceland stands for” (words of Skuli Mogensen, CEO of WOW air) has such terrible customer service. Also, apparently if you turn WOW upside down it reads “MOM” because they like to think of themselves as “being a part of one big happy family” the planes on their fleet also have names like “Dad, Gma, Gpa, Luv”. What sort of corny nonsense is this? I have never been stranded somewhere for 5 days because an airline can’t deliver. Most airlines have customer service at the airport, assist their customers immediately and see to it that they get to their final destination as soon as possible (i.e. within 24 hrs, without making one pay more to cover for their incompetence).

However it's the 60% in which the way they handled the situation is what made me never want to fly with them again. So allow me to give a little backstory. I was flying from Dublin airport to Reykjavik so that I could get to Miami by that evening. Immediately when I got on the flight we all got texts saying that the flight to Miami was delayed and could be delayed for up to a day (8 am the following morning) due to technical reasons. A little disappointing but what can you do? It happens.  We landed on time in Iceland. Now here is where the review turns sour. So I didn't have any checked in luggage or anything just carry on but other passengers did. Not only did a lot of baggage not get through but they were forced to sit there and wait for over 2 hours until Wow Air sorted it out for them. I spent at least 45 minutes with them until I went to go find a Wow Air rep to handle it. They were nowhere to be found. We were told to go to a meeting point to see what would happen next? They said they'd provide us with a hotel and complimentary meal as compensation. So i went to the meeting point and there was no one there. Eventually people showed up. We waited up to 2 and a half hours for reps to come along and start handing out information about the hotels we were booked in. Eventually I was given a hotel and comp for a meal and I went onto the bus. The bus did not leave for 3 hours. 3 hours of waiting and all the while Wow Air did nothing to tell us what was going on.

Everything was fine and we again booked them, this time June 2017 for Baltimore to Amsterdam and return on July. It is my opinion that as they have grown in passenger numbers they have done nothing to increase their workforce to compensate for the increased work load. The result of our trip in both directions is a definite “we will never return to WOW.”  Baltimore to Keflavik. Delayed about one hour. The WOW employee on the bus to the terminal directed us to an incorrect Keflavik gate, resulting in a missed connection to Amsterdam. Luckily, WOW rebooked us on a flight later that day. Since we now had an 8-hour wait, I requested they pay our lunch. Refused. Prior to boarding the new flight, I asked the Keflavik WOW Customer Desk where my luggage would be. The answer was that it was on the new flight because, “it must travel with the passenger”. Keflavik to Amsterdam. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, we waited until every bag on our flight had been processed at baggage claim. I was then redirected to the freight handler for WOW who had our bags, having received them on the morning flight we had missed that day. They did not travel with us on our evening flight. Flight 3 – Amsterdam to Keflavik – The WOW ticket area in Amsterdam is poorly marked and you cannot see it until directly in front. Consequently, we walked the terminal near gate M for more than 15 minutes before finding the WOW line. It extended deeply into the terminal because WOW had only 4 of 7 desks open to receive people. The wait time to the check-in was about 45 minutes. This flight had mechanical problems and managed to depart about 3 hours late. Flight 4 – Keflavik to Baltimore (July 19). Arrival in Keflavik was at 3:15 PM to catch a 3:30 PM connection. The helpful WOW attendant at the end of the gateway said, “Read the sign”. She gave no guidance on how to reach that gate, or the requirement to go through passport control. Our BWI connection was at gate D22b. There were no WOW personnel to help at all. We made it to gate D22 to find no attendant. About 150 feet away from D22 is a very small sign “D22b” at the stairs. The WOW attendant at this gate said, “No worry your flight is delayed 30 minutes. I no longer have your reserved/paid seats but will give you seats 1B and 1C. Go down the steps and get on the bus.” At the bottom of the steps was an open bus full of people with no driver and no WOW personnel. This flight, scheduled for 3:30 PM finally departed at around 5:30 PM because “we are waiting for an attendant who needs to get to Baltimore”. Naturally, our luggage remained in Keflavik. I made several phone calls the next day to attempt to locate it. This resulted in everyone saying “we do not have a manifest but we will call you when WW117 luggage is downloaded tonight (July 20).

The money we ""saved"" on these tickets plus the baggage fees for roundtrip actually cost more than a ticket on another airline. We will not be duped again.

Since all their flights connect in Reykjavik, you have 4 segments and they charge bag fees for each segment. The flights are crowded, food is not great and it costs a lot.

Art this point I didn't know what to do, my trip was well planned and my kids were waiting for me.

Our flight arrived about 80 minutes late into Iceland which caused twenty of us to miss the Frankfurt flight by about 15 minutes. WOW chose not to hold the Frankfurt flight for us, and they only have one flight per day. WOW does not have any arrangements with other airlines to transport passengers like us. So you are stuck in Iceland until they can get you on another flight in the coming days. No person at the airport (including uniformed WOW personnel) has the authority to re-ticket you. It has to be done via email or phone. This was shocking, given that this is actually their hub airport! My emails took two days to have a response. By that point I had purchased a one way ticket to Frankfurt on Icelandair, which more than negated my savings with Wow. If you do not purchase 'extra legroom' seats, you will be sorry!

We kept trying to obtain information and support from the desk agents, but they simply handed us a small slip of paper with the telephone number to customer service the desk agents informed us that they were routinely not provided with flight information nor were they empowered to provide support. We called customer service multiple times for the first hour, the calls would either not go through or the line was so bad upon answering that nothing could be understood. As we were not able to immediately reach anyone by phone, I sent a text response “Can someone please call me?” to which I received the response “Hi, Thank you for the text message. More information and support please go to our website wo”. Finally, after nearly two hours, we were able to speak to someone, who was rather dismissive on the whole, by phone but were then placed on hold for nearly 45 minutes while they consulted someone else. The representative indicated that we would have to be re-booked for 1 July or have our money refunded. Again, no justification for our being bumped was provided and the representative told us it was too late to board the BWI-KEF flight, even though the flight crew had not even reported yet (they passed us while on the phone). We asked for a WOW connecting flight to Paris since we could see that there were open seats the representative stated we could not be accommodated although he refused to provide any justification. We stressed that we had two young children, no place in the area to stay, and non-refundable obligations in France. He held firm to the 1 July re-booking date we therefore had no choice but to request a refund. As it was growing late and our children were tired, we re-approached the desk agent regarding a free hotel room that had been mentioned, but she informed us that the hotel room was only available for those who re-booked their flights. Having no options, we booked an expensive (US$10,330) last-minute flight with Air France. We were shocked to find out that both WOW flights actually occurred without issue except for being late. Our suspicion is that WOW was concerned that the late departure from BWI would have prevented our being able to catch the connecting flight and WOW would have had to accommodate us in accordance with EU Flight Compensation Regulations.

In addition to all of this it was unclear in my receipt that I received from wow whether or not I was charged for baggage as it read that I had paid nothing for checked and carry on bags. By the time I was leaving for the airport and reviewing my ticket I had a minor panic as I didn't want to pay the exaggerated fees at the airport for checked bags should I need to buy them there.

All of those things a customer dreads about flying not only occurred, but surpassed any other experience we've had. It started with the hidden fees. When we checked in, we were expecting we would have to pay to check our bags. This had been communicated in an email, however an additional 65 euros for a backpack is unacceptable. The size or weight of the bag is also not considered, so you pay the same for a backpack that weights 8kg as luggage that potentially weighs much more. So I told my sister since we were early, maybe we could do some rearranging and that way we could only check one bag and carry on another. To this, the representative informed us that even a carry on bag would be 57 euros. To WOW air, are you expecting your customers to enjoy Iceland or wherever without clothes? We were exhausted at the end of our trip, but excited to return home and this was the obstacle that we had to face: an extra 130 euros to take our belonging home in our medium sized backpacks. After our experience checking in, I knew not to expect anything from this horrible airline. And I was right, in a three hour flight with 8+ staff members we didn't even receive a cup of water. When we landed we were really hungry. What is a big deal to me is that when we were in the terminal in Iceland we got ripped off on food and drinks like never before.

When we check in our bags finally the process takes about 30 minutes with confusion and changing seats and questions passengers have. The flight we are told is delayed an hour and a half, as you may or may not know the flight to Iceland which is our layover is about 5.5 hours. We are already behind and are running late. They board us in a hurry, there is no entertainment or refreshments provided without a fee. Okay we bypass that and realize that the seats are so small we cannot sit properly, they seem almost childlike and are very hard seats. As we land it is raining and they tell us we have to be rushed through because we are delaying the other plane from taking off. When we depart the plane they rush us through security and every other measure available for safety. Now we are wet and pushed into another uncomfortable flight without any answers as to our bags. When we land in France our bags are not there and we are told to wait an hour until they are located. Fast forward a couple of days when we are set to go home. The flight is delayed 2 hours and we change gates 3 different times. this plane to KEF is much nicer than the original 2 planes we had been on.

Maybe WOW was oversold and took our seats on a costly random pretext and were then caught in the middle when we showed up with boarding passes. Maybe their San Francisco ground staff were just incompetent and their management decided to be unaccountable. Whatever the reason for denying us passage you could not make this up.

We arrived in time - we would claim them later and actually we were prepared to never see them again due to the seriousness of the trip. But in SFO the WOW gate agent refused to let us board unless we checked our bags from another airline. This was not an international flight and TSA and Alaska Airlines did not require bag collection and both plus WOW themselves said leave them as they were the other side of security and would be kept until claimed or disposed of as lost. I told gate agent why it was critical to board and we would claim bags from the other airline later. ""Go get your bags now!"" I asked if the flight would wait but all the agent would say gruffly is ""We are boarding!"". We were ordered to get the bags even though the check in counter was obviously closed The WOW manager then spoke to someone at the closed desk to tell us to bring the bags through TSA passenger check point?! Of course after going back through the long security line we were turned back by a TSA supervisor who could not believe that WOW had told us to bring suitcases through the passenger security line.

Maybe even if you do select a seat. I have been on many types of aircraft and many different airlines. I don't think I have ever been on any flight, anytime or anywhere, where so many seats were crammed onto the plane and so little room was available.

With 2 exhausted small kids at 4am local time, we had to find ourselves a hotel for the 9 hours. The customer service desk said WOW air could not put us up in a hotel, but would refund us if we submitted a claim. We submitted the claim, but 3 months later haven't heard anything back. After reading a few reviews, it seems WOW air just ignores online claims. When we finally got on our connecting flight, we found it was a charter aircraft because Wow's own plane had broken down. It was even worse than the Wow planes we flew on - less legroom, really tatty and old, and 2 of the toilets were out of use. Just terrible.

I took the train in from Ottawa, and arrived pretty early in Montreal. I received an update at 3pm, indicating that my departure was delayed and the gate had changed. Annoying, but better than what ended up happening.  Close to my new departure time (8:20pm) I make my way to the gate desk, because they say that there is an announcement for those with connections to Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Initially thought it was going to be info on my new connection - it was a message telling me that due to poor weather my flight to Amsterdam was a no go. The weather wasn't affecting the Montreal to Reykjavik part, but the Reykjavik to Amsterdam part. Furthermore, apparently there were no hotels available in Reykjavik, so I was not getting on the flight. After close to 1.5 hours on hold, I get a customer service rep. I can either cancel booking or reschedule. Next available flight is 1 March, making a week long vacation that much shorter and probably not worth the amount of air travel. So I cancel.  But because I cancel and not reschedule.. they airline isn't obligated to put me in a hotel. They cancel on me, and I'm on the hook? After some discussion, they were able to make an exception for me and I got a hotel room. And I stress exception.. they repeated it a lot. If they cancel on me with little to no notice, why would it be on me?! They also attempted to blame me for not going to the ticket counter upon arrival to the airport. They said starting around 4pm, they were letting guests know that their flights were cancelled. So it's my fault I arrived there early!? Why weren't announcements made? Why wasn't a text sent to me, like the flight delay was? I even messaged on twitter, clearly indicating I was on the Amsterdam flight. I received a response but nothing indicating a complete cancellation.  Somewhat annoyed and unable to sleep. I decided to check out the Reykjavik departure website. Guess what? My flight to Amsterdam not only wasn't cancelled,  it took off. Also, there is a flight from Reykjavik to Amsterdam in the morning of 28 Feb. Could be full, but why wasn't there effort made for me to make that? I understand flights get cancelled, I'm not the first person it's happened too. But the behaviour of the airline is unfair at best, and sketchy in my opinion. Why was my flight really cancelled? Was it overbooked and one way of dealing with it is just cancelling certain connections? Why wasn't I allowed to go to Reykjavik and explore other options there? Why didn't they inform me of the changes as soon as they were known? Why is there no responsibility for the airline to take care of those they inconvenience so drastically? Why didn't they try to help me get a flight with another organization? Where is the accountability?

Pack all of your own snacks, and buy all your beverages at the gate, because you will get nothing complimentary during the flight. We missed out flight coming home, and they were less than helpful to get us get home again. When we realized what had happen, they didn't have a ticketing station there or any personnel to help us figure out how we were going to get home.

The key is that you know what you are getting into prior to buying. This is a low cost airline if you follow the system.  My trip stayed cheap, because I was able to just take a single carry on: one 32 L backpack which was approved as my free personal item for the cabin.

We got the same unfriendly check-in staff, even though I had contacted Wow Air to change my carry on bag to checked in and had receipt in hand, the manager had to assist where the check-in staff person wasn't inclined to believe I had prepaid and wanted to charge a lot more. Be aware that its definitely better to prepay for luggage than incur significantly extra charges at check-in or at the gate if the staff deem your bag too big or too many bags than allowance. Our flight out of Montreal was delayed. We were impressed we got texts about the delays. Unfortunately, our connecting flight in Keflavik was also delayed and further delayed - for other delayed flights to ensure those passengers got onto connecting flights. Wow Air could have and should have given people a free drink or snack to make up for it. Small gestures go a long way. We landed in Berlin 4 hours late and our car rental company considered us a ""no show"" and cancelled our reservation. Already suggested to Wow Air and Enterprise Rent-A-Car that Wow Air be added to Enterprise Rent-A-Car website pull down menu so that the Enterprise knows your flight is delayed. We were pretty exhausted and not in the best of spirits after 25 hours of travel. On our way home, Berlin SXF airport is not the easiest to navigate or find Wow Air (Terminal A) and our flight was delayed - without any explanation. People appreciate knowing ""why"" - even if there is nothing that can be done. We had to hustle in Keflavik to make our connecting flight to Montreal - which meant we couldn't buy food or drink at the airport as intended. Also learned buy enough food and drink for both flights! Since we were starving and thirsty, we decided to cave in and pay approx. $50 for sandwich, slice of pizza, coffee, soda pop, water, small Pringles. When we arrived in Montreal, we waited between ~45 mins at the carousel until we realized that our luggage hadn't made it. Only then, did we know that all the people from Berlin's flight had not gotten their bags. We spent another 2+ hours waiting in line to get the right form, then go to customs with the form, go back to the same line to drop off form. Luggage arrived in Iqaluit three days later. Making a claim for incurred expenses due to delayed bags but had to figure out how myself - seems Wow doesn't provide info or facilitate reimbursement or provide a stated allowance.",SXF to YUL via KEF,2,3,wow-air,WOW air customer review,Couple Leisure,,3,0,a2aadc0f-9756-49e4-acca-b66e61d12c74

,WOW air,Economy Class,January 2017,10th January 2017,0,0,1,UnitedKingdom,1.0,no,"Bristol to Boston return via Reykjavik. I booked with WOW air expecting a very basic service which was originally proven with a £50 charge for a main bag each way, although overall this was still cheaper than competitors. The real issues began when I got to Bristol airport at 9:00 for my 10:45 flight, being told around 10:00 that there was a delay and that more information would be provided at 11:00. When 11:00 came we were told that the flight would be delayed until 23:00 that evening. Not being best pleased, I contacted their customer service in India to rearrange another flight as I needed to be in Boston that evening, although I was told I would need to speak to the claims department who conveniently didn't have a phone number and only operated by email. As I was only being given prewritten answers by the phone operator I asked to speak to a supervisor which never answered (in total I was on hold for 3.5 hours throughout the day). On a later phone call I was told the delay was for weather reasons which obviously wasn't true, only being told when I boarded the flight after delays to 23:55, 00:20 (and not taking off until 01:45 because a printer wasn't working), that there was a family emergency for a member of the crew and someone else had to be flown in from Iceland, but due to regulations on shift times, all staff members had to take a long break. Upon arrival in Iceland at around 5:00, I was forced to wait for another 40 minutes before any representatives from wow air turned up to tell us to get on a coach before we were shipped off to a hostel, at which point we were told by the hostel staff that we had to be out the rooms by 11, and a bus should be coming later that day but they knew just as much as we did because wow air hadn't told them anything either. After 4 hours of sleep I was up at 11, to be told the bus would leave at 12 and my flight to Boston would be at 3pm. Eventually the bus didn't turn up until 2 and my flight was delayed until 6, so I didn't arrive in Boston for a full 30 hours after I should've been there, as a result missing a family event that I was supposed to be for that day. I strongly considered cancelling the return flight in and flying with a different airline in order to avoid ever having to deal with WOW air again although eventually decided that surely it couldn't get any worse. In fairness I wasn't delayed 30 hours this time, only 2 hours on each flight, but when that seems like a positive result one really must question the standards of the airline. Any advice to people considering travelling with WOW air would be 1) don't, and 2) if you really have to, leave yourself a few days either side and be prepared to be treated like an animal in transit for the duration of your journey, however many days that is. Obviously I've had a very bad experience which most probably won't, but all four of my flights with wow air have been delayed which says it all really. One last thing, if you decide to travel with them and have to claim compensation, claims aren't processed for 'between 8-10 weeks'.",BRS to BOS via KEF,2,2,wow-air,question standards of the airline,Solo Leisure,,1,0,5de83bdc-6baa-4143-9582-2ffe62ff3a09

The sector from Keflavik to Paris CDG was the last out of 4 sectors flown this past holiday season and all 4 sectors were delayed anywhere from 1 to 3 hours. My observation is there is lack of organization on the ground which delays the flights, and winter weather in Iceland not ideal for any flight with less than 3 hour connection. We sat on the runway in hold to get to a gate for 2 hours until the wind settled down. We were forced to use steps in a blizzard to get off the plane to a waiting bus. I saw many people almost fall due to strong winds. On the return sector YYZ-KEF, they announced that any traveller without a purple or yellow tag on their hand luggage should line up beside the departure gate. Half the gate hold room lined up and WOW staff proceeded to put bags into a sizer and collect money for those that were too big. This slowed down boarding for everyone else. The plane eventually left over an hour behind schedule. Due to favorable winds, we were to land in KEF at 0500 am with time to make our connection to CDG at 0600. We made it, but our bags did not. There were over 50 passengers from YYZ and YUL on the same connecting flight. We all stood like dummies in Paris waiting for our bags at the belt. After the last bag came off - no one from WOW air was there to guide us to a the service desk. eventually we found the ground handler and proceeded to line up to file a lost bag report. If they knew our bags had not made the flight, why could they not have had someone waiting in CDG to announce this to all the travellers affected? We were connecting to Singapore the next day at 11am. Unfortunately, the bags would not come in until 1030 am the next day and not in time to collect and transfer to our next flight. We ended up having to pay for an extra night in Paris and change our Singapore flight by 24 hours. Very inconvenient all around. Plus had to buy basic essentials and meals. WOW has low fares.

As most people here that have left reviews on this site, my conclusion is just spend the extra money on a company that actually knows what it's doing. Every single flight during my last trip (4 flights total) were delayed for at least 1.5h each. The first one for more than 4 hours. After a quick look at Toronto airport's historic data for flights offered by WOW Air (between Toronto and Keflavik) I found that not a single flight had left on time during the last 2/3 weeks. It's actually funny to hear the captain repeat the exact same thing during every flight: ""I hope the delay did not cause any big inconvenience."" I'm pretty sure it's an integral part of the script. To top it all off, I paid for an XXL seat on my way back and none were available when I finally boarded the plane. This airline is utter garbage.

,WOW air,Economy Class,January 2017,2nd January 2017,1,1,2,Canada,1.0,no,"Paris to Montreal via Keflavik. Our experience with WOW air began with the confusing information about how much we could bring with us on the plane, due to the contradictory pages of the website. It continued at our arrival at the registering desk. Even if we were only three hours in advance for our flight, employees didn't even gave access to the queue lanes, so all the passengers that were waiting for the opening of the desk just stacked in the middle of the way in the airport. When boarding, the plane, there was only one incredibly slow employee receiving guests, so we all had to block the airport''s passage for more than an hour. In the plane, there was still garbage of previous passengers. The captain speaked english so bad and we were so not informed that nobody that didn't speak Icelandic had any clue about what was going on from this point. On board employees were the least helpful that I've seen during my trips. Food was incredibly costly on board. That was especially frustrating due to the three hours of hardly explained delay that we had to spend on board. After our landing in Rekjavik, we had to wait in queue another time, but this time outdoor, for a non sufficient bus to take us to the airport. The airport's organisation was just terrible. While three employees were doing nothing at the customs for people travellings to US, we waited for more than half an hour for people travelling to UK and Canada. Then we had to rush for our connecting flight, and after an awkward forced passage through the airport's shop, we would get to our gate only after 10 minutes due to the still unbelievable queues of stacked people waiting everywhere in the middle of the place. We got to the gate of our connecting flight while the passengers of our flight were called to board immediately, but just to wait another half of an hour without any explanation in a stationary bus. During our bus trip to the plane, I saw poor people (yes, another time), waiting outdoor in stationnary queues in front of the stairs leading to their plane. The icing on the cake was that, finally arrived home, we realised that Wow lost the luggage of all the people travelling on my connection from Paris to Montreal.

Like so many others, I was attracted by the low sticker price the airline is offering for tickets: $440 roundtrip to Frankfurt from Boston, before the holidays, seemed incredible. I did do some research ahead of time, reading up on the restrictions and reviews and thought that I had a fairly good understanding about what I was getting into. I only had carry on, correct (small size and weight), bought food ahead of time, etc. Even with this knowledge, and low expectations, the experience was pretty bad. 4 hours delay getting out of Boston. The good news was that the connecting planes tend to wait, so at least I wasn't stranded in Iceland. But because I had to get to Munich via train the overall trip took around 20 hrs or so. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly makes this airline so abysmal, since on paper it just sounds like any other US airline: no food, no service, delays, little communication, fee for checked luggage, etc. But everything seemed multiplied, perhaps of longer flights than domestic US flight. If you're in a position where you could take another airline (ie. it's not about whether or not you will make the trip) choose another carrier. I could see a very small subset of travelers benefitting from WOW : super flexible, forced to take it because otherwise you couldn't go, and being the type of person who doesn't get upset about much.

The staff at BWI were cheerful and quite helpful. They checked my carry-on luggage and had no problem with it, as it was well within allowance in weight and size. The outbound flights were relatively smooth and uneventful. The problems came when I returned from my extended weekend trip, from Copenhagen. They decided at the gate that I was exceeding my allowances in size. They said that both my small carry on item and my personal item both had to go under the seat in front of me, that I could not use the overhead space for my small carry on, and that I had to pay $100 to upgrade to the ""large carry on"" or they would not allow me to fly. They also said that the small carry-on and the personal item both had to fit within the small carry-on allowance (42x32x25cm). However, their website is quite clear that the allowance for the small carry-on and the personal item (42x20x20cm) are exclusive. Also, the website states that the personal item must fit under the seat in front of you. No mention that the ""small carry-on"" must also fit under the seat also, which would be quite difficult to do. I pulled up the website and tried to show the staff this, but they refused. So I was forced to pay the extra $100. I hoped that this would all be sorted out via their customer service when I returned to the US, and even provided photographic evidence of the size of my baggage. But their response was that they  trust their employees at the airport to follow the carry-on policy and they refused to give me a refund. Thanks to this extra $100 fee, their flight became more expensive than other airlines that offer meals, larger baggage allowances, and other amenities.

Promises of 'budget Friendly' were just the start. Me and my partner flew from Athens to Gatwick, £300 with cabin overhead baggage not included? (We are from Australia where this is standard for all airlines) If the tickets were actually budget I would understand. We arrived at Athens airport to find our flight delayed 2 hours. Ok, it's bad having your flight delayed but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since this happens to a lot of airlines. We looked up the aircraft info to find that there was no previous flight. As we waited at the airport we had 5 or 6 different times given to us by Wizz. Once the gate finally opened we made our way. We sat on the ground since seating was not available. Once we were ok to board we were put onto a bus to go to the plane. Once we arrived the driver opened the doors, told us ""don't exit yet"" and so we were left on the bus (packed in very tightly, there are no seats) for 15-20 minutes as we watched the cabin crew cleaning the plane through the windows. Why drive us out if the aircraft is not ready? And the plane has not had a previous flight AND was delayed 2 hours, the plane should have been prepared already? Once we finally got off the bus we were met by what I would find out to be some of the rudest hosts on a plane I have ever met. Every 5 seconds over the PA ""please do not block the aisles to avoid further delays"" to me seemed a bit rich after our experience so far. Also people are boarding, we aren't going to be seated in 3 seconds? When we sat, the aircraft was in a disgustingly awful state. Crumbs are everywhere, rubbish was left in the seat pockets. This aircraft was sitting here at the airport for a long time and the crew had done an abysmal job at preparing for passengers. The flight itself, once we got into the air was ok. Nothing special (they like to push their 'duty free' items on you for purchase, however I found that I could buy most of this stuff at Tesco for half the price). We landed at Gatwick and this is where the true torture began. Passengers stood to collect their luggage. As we were departing, the host grabbed the PA, stared directly into passengers eyes with the most disgusting look I have ever seen from flight crew ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" this was met with passengers fuming, how are we meant to get our luggage down then? He repeated it as I walked towards the front door of the aircraft ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" he proceeded to put down the microphone then step in front of me, put his finger to my face and said ""WAIT"" passengers piled behind me after this man had just told us not to block the aisles. He put his finger down ""ok go"". Me and my partner were livid. The consistent snarky rude comments from this crew was he worst customer service experience I had ever read not just from an airline but from any company I have ever dealt with.

The Wow Air gate personnel called for passengers to certify their carry-ons before the flight. Since I carried only a 33-liter lightweight backpack, they quickly slapped their purple You May Pass tag on its handle. I kept that tag on the bag for all four flight segments with Wow, and was never asked about it again. Perhaps because they examined the bags earlier, there was no baggage-related delay or backlog at boarding. We were shuffled onto a descending escalator to a small room but not allowed to board for a few minutes. With no one in charge in that small room, we passengers had to spread out to allow the unending flow to get off the escalator. It could have become a problem, and although it didn't, I'll dock Wow one rating point for that. On board, was as advertised. Food and drinks, even water, cost money. (I especially enjoyed the ~$9 hot ham and cheese sandwich.) Legroom was better than on Southwest. There was no entertainment, but there were two power plugs in every three-seat row, so forewarned passengers such as me could watch as much video as we brought with us. All four segments departed and arrived about on time. The Frankfurt to Keflavik plane did not have power plugs, though it did have six channels of music in the armrests. Service was friendly, and as I mentioned, there were no problems. I'm happy to recommend Wow Air as a cheap option for Europe to America flights, but not so much from America to Europe. Wow's US flights all depart in the early evening for arrival in Iceland in the wee hours, with hurried connections to Europe arriving in the morning. With an early evening departure and a slightly overwarm cabin, I found it hard to convince my body to sleep during the five-hour Atlantic flight. Pulling an all-nighter like that didn't help my jet lag. I'd much rather take an early morning flight to get to Europe around bedtime or a late-night flight with a better chance of napping. If you don't get caught in one of the horror stories listed by other travelers here, Wow Air gives you exactly what it says it will : An amazing price if you're willing to travel light and bring your own entertainment.

We paid $60 dollars in SFO for two people to eat a sandwich and  crisps each, and 2 drinks. Not far off the same price in Keflavik. Good choice of food but expensive. The carry on baggage is smaller than any other airline and they are very strict with this, it is smaller than a normal size carry on suitecase, enough for a small backpack or handbag. Some people did have suitecases as hand luggage but they were very small. Make sure you look up the dimensions as it is £13 per kg if your bag is overweight and £75 at the desk to check in your bag and they will police this. Both inbound and outbound flight times were changed prior to travelling and flight was slightly delayed on the way back. Short lay over times in Keflavik which was great and the flights were on time apart from a 20 minute delay from SFO-KEF. Not too sure if I saved that much money in the long run, as I had to travel over 100 miles from my home to London Gatwick and stay in a hotel the night before my inbound flight, then pay airport / airline prices for food and drink. Probably didn't save enough to suffer this flight again.

There is no entertainment on board, no free seat selection, and a fee for large carry-on or checked baggage, but this was all made clear before booking. My return flight from LGW to YUL was incredibly cheap, even booked last-minute. Check-in online was standard, and like other budget airlines, there is no free seat selection even at check-in. My primary complaint was with the boarding method/time. From LGW to KEF, boarding took a very long time (much longer than they had allowed time for) because every person has their carry-on checked and tagged, and many people have to pay fees based on the size of their bags. This made the boarding process very long, and as a result, the flight was 55 minutes late getting off the ground. From KEF to YUL, boarding was also approximately 15 minutes late (even with a half-full aircraft), and then we sat at the gate for another 30 minutes due to a paperwork issue. However, all these complaints aside, I arrived in YUL only 11 minutes behind schedule, which I thought was great. As for on-board service, the crew seemed friendly, and unlike other budget airlines, they were not pushy at all. A few passes with the refreshment trolly, and a single pass with the duty-free. Very tasteful in my opinion unlike other budget carriers that bombard you for a full flight making it impossible to sleep or keep to yourself. So, I have to say, overall I was very impressed with WOW and will most certainly fly with them again. For the difference in flight cost compared to other carriers, I could have actually purchased myself a brand new tablet for entertainment along with my flights and it still would have come out cheaper than the other airlines.

We got an exceptional deal on tickets from LAX to CDG. I was initially hesitant to fly with them based on online reviews. I read about frequent delays and lack of customer service. Speaking solely from my experience, they were punctual and the customer service was exceptional. I suspect the bulk of complaints arise from the fact that they have luggage size restrictions and they do not provide meals and in-flight entertainment as part of the ticket price. However, you're flying to Europe for 1/5 the price of many airlines! To cope with these limitations, I suggest to bring your own entertainment, load up on food at the airports, pack lightly (invest in a good backpack) and make sure you have a buffer in your schedule since most WOW flights have layovers in Iceland (which is an incredible place).

I arrived at Boston airport on 19/6/16 and was told at the WOW check-in desk that my flight to Keflavik would be delayed. I was given 100% assurance that my connecting flight to Bristol would not be affected. This was not true, my connecting flight was affected and I missed it. I'm pretty sure they knew this but lied to us all so that they wouldn't be liable for reimbursements. Not a good start! We got stranded at KEF of course, and were given no information and no flight options other than being told to go to a hotel and wait. WOW does not employ anyone directly on the ground at KEF (their home airport) which means there's literally nobody to talk to there. I found this completely bizarre for an airline but it makes sense as they try to avoid assisting their passengers at all costs. While stranded in Iceland we received zero information about anything. My many emails, tweets and phone calls to WOW were ignored and nobody from the airline got in touch with us until a note mysteriously appeared in the Soviet-style 'hotel' saying that we would be bused back to KEF early the next morning. When we arrived at the check-in desk the next day nobody knew who we were and nobody had a record of our bookings! I originally paid to fly to Bristol but would have taken any flight to the UK at that point. However, WOW staff refused to book me on their flight to London Gatwick (or any other flight). Because WOW refused to get me on a flight to the UK, I was forced to pay for an Icelandair flight. However and bizarrely, 30mins before the WOW flight to Gatwick departed, the staff suddenly agreed to put me on the flight and I eventually flew to Gatwick. I have no idea why it required 2hrs of persuasion and for me to book another flight before this happened - it should have happened as soon as I arrived at the airport. The experience was crazy and stressful. I arrived in Gatwick and I was required to buy a train ticket to take me to my final destination (Bristol).

In fact one of the worst airlines I’ve ever flown with. First of all WOW advertises extremely cheap flights to Reykjavik, and from the offset I was wary at such cheap deals. They were over half the price of Icelandair. I paid for extras whilst booking my ticket online including seat reservations and for a ‘large’ carry on bag. Yes you have to pay for any carry on luggage. The total cost was still below that of Icelandair. When we got to the airport I was shocked to find the airline weighs carry on luggage. And the limit is so low, you’d basically only be traveling with a few pairs of jeans and shirts to fit in the weight allowance. Our WOW Air check in representative suggested we have to pay over $130 to check the bags in the hold, or alternatively we could pay him a cash fee of $80 to take the bags onboard. He couldn’t issue a receipt for this ‘cash fee’ but we opted for it as it was the cheaper option, and it meant we didn’t have to wait for our luggage the other side. He assured me I could call up WOW Air to receive a refund for my original ‘checked bag’ fee. I called up immediately after passing security, initially I was hung up on twice, and the third time was informed I could absolutely not receive a refund and they did not believe my story of the representative asking for cash because I didn’t receive a receipt to prove it. Because I was so angry at these extra fees, I failed to realize myself an my friend were sat in completely different parts of the plane despite having paid and booked for specific seats on my original booking. The flight itself was uneventful although the plane was extremely old and absolutely no entertainment even for a flight over 5 hours. Upon landing at Keflavik airport I tweeted WOWAir at my dismay and they promptly responded asking for my booking reference number and they would look into it. I messaged them listing the issues I had only to receive a message in return insinuating that I was lying about the check in representative asking for cash. And they also gave a lame excuse as to why myself and my friend weren’t sat next to each other, because apparently I had amended my booking and therefore forfeited the seats I’d paid for and chosen specifically. May I add this was all on a Twitter message - they didn’t even have the courtesy to call or send me an official email. Absolutely unprofessional, shocking service from start to finish.

She said no, it should have been done before, it's too late now. We paid the money and noticed a women in the next check in to ours, crying because she had to pay for her bag and she had no money and no credit cards. The attendants stated that these were the rules. After boarding we were informed that food and drinks would be sold in any currency we wanted or a credit card - nothing is complimentary.

We had trouble, for example, with our initial online flight reservation getting confirmed. But, when it came the day to travel from San Francisco one-way to Reykjavík on WOW Air, our having kept our fingers crossed paid off. Our flight check-in was very smooth, our departure gate was no mystery (even if it was, you can't miss the plane, for goodness sake!). Boarding was efficient with plenty of room to settle in for the 7.5 hour flight. The seats weren't very comfortable, and that did put a crimp in the plans to sleep our way over so we would be ready-to-go when we arrived 5 am the next morning.

I was left in a frantic search for another flight as I had a connecting flight and would have missed it due to this new timing, and luckily found a (very expensive) seat on Icelandair at a similar timing. At the airport I saw several other travelers stranded and not offered any assistance. Some were not as lucky as they didn't check their emails the night before and were not aware of the change.

Now the long story: I specifically bought a return flight with Wizz Flex option, in total amount of 260 Eur (212 Eur the actual flight fare and the rest in fees). So I would expect (after reading the Terms & Conditions of Wizz Flex), in the eventuality of asking for refund, to be entitled to 212 Eur back. I postponed the flight once. During this process, the Wizz Air website shows you available dates and after you select the new dates, it computes the price for the new flight and shows you only if there is a difference in price in their favour (if you have to pay something extra or not). I did this, nothing extra to pay, all good here. Later it became clear I will not be able to travel at all, so I went for the second benefit of the Wizz Flex, cancelling and getting a full refund. Surprise: Wizz Air congratulates me for being eligible for a full refund: 40 Eur! At this point I spend more money to call them (the only way to contact is by phone, charge with 1.2 Eur per min), to find out that when I postponed the flight, my refund value was automatically changed to the value of the flight from those new dates. A value which was not even displayed to me during this process. Again, during flight change, Wizz Air computes the value of the new flight and only shows you if you have to pay more for the new dates. It purposely does not warn you that not only you don't have to pay more, but that you are exchanging tickets worth 260 Eur to tickets worth 40 Eur and that this will affect your refund value too. Besides this practice being so obviously mean to trick you, is this even legal? To make a parallel, it is not legal to run an online shop that shows products you can buy, to charge your customers and to not show them the price they will be charged with.

However, we don't plan on taking the airline again because we still didn't feel it was a good value for our money. Here are some points that we found particularly frustrating: There were very few agents to check in at the CDG airport in Paris, which meant we waited in a long line (perhaps this is why we did get away with taking our regular sized carry-on luggage for which one would normally be required to pay a fee on WOW air) - Our transit at KEF was relatively short, which meant we had no time to buy food or fill our water bottles in the airport. This was when we really did not appreciate having to pay for water on board and felt that it was a bit abusive on the airline's part, especially for a 5+ hour flight. We ordered the pizza for 8 euros, which was tasteless and quite considering the price. Many of the food options were sold out or unavailable.  Our flight to Boston left about 30-45 minutes late due to the airline needing to locate someone's luggage, which meant unloading and reloading nearly all the luggage .

We checked in online the night before, the Wow website said the flight was on time, when we woke up the website said the flight was on time, when we arrived at LAX several hours early the flight was still showing as on time both on their website and at the airport - we had not received any email or sms reporting any delay. We could not find a check in point, so we went to look for a WOW desk and there wasn't one. This was around 10am so we asked the information desk and found out the flight was delayed about 12 hours. There were no personnel at the airport for us to communicate with, and our several attempts to call the customer service telephone number were in vain, as we would wait 20 minutes on hold only to be hung up on repeatedly. We therefore had to buy another flight through a different airline to ensure we arrived on time to our destination, to ensure all of our future flights, tours and hotels would not be missed. This was a monstrous inconvenience as we had not budgeted for an entire new flight. If we would have stayed and taken that flight, which we found out through Facebook later (because no one from WOW had responded to our multiple attempts to contact them via email, Facebook messenger, phone) had not arrived in Amsterdam until Thursday morning, a full day later, we would have completely missed our flight to Italy by nearly four hours.

This was my first time with the airline and I can surely say that it will also be my last. When I booked the tickets the price was about 20% below comparable pricing from the other major airlines, and even though I had never heard of WOW before I went ahead and booked the ticket. I didn't realize that WOW is a total budget airline in the spirit of Ryanair and other bare bones carriers but was soon to find it. When I checked in online I was surprised to find that I couldn't select a seat (you will have to pay a premium to do this during the ticket purchasing process) and I was assigned a seat on the very last row with barely any recline. I checked in online and printed out a boarding pass. When boarding the plane at LAX my boarding pass was refused and I was reassigned another seat after everybody else had boarded and after the ground staff had been on call with the WOW call center for more than 30 min. The flight ended up being about 2 hours delayed because they were waiting for ""paperwork to be completed"" so I barely made my connecting flight in Reykjavik while having to run through the gates. There is absolutely no service inside the plane, no entertainment system of any kind and no food or drink service unless you pay for it. You have but 2 buttons at your seat - one for reclining your seat and another for turning the reading light on and off. I finally arrived in Copenhagen and immediately decided to pay for seat reservations to avoid problems on my flight back to LAX, but the WOW air reservation system again failed to reserve the seats - even after charging my credit card. After being on hold for 30 minutes I finally reached a customer service agent who was able to get the seats correctly assigned to me. The basic tickets are cheap but you end up paying an additional $200 or so just for seats and luggage (WOW only allows 5kg/11pounds of free carry on) so my advice it to pay a bit more and go with a regular airline - WOW air is just not worth it.",LAX to CPH via KEF,1,2,wow-air,WOW air is just not worth it,Solo Leisure,,2,0,881da15c-fcfb-48a7-b341-fe019499d243

Flight delayed, from what I understand from my travel agent, not the airline, 23 hours. Arrived at LAX at 6.30 for a flight that was to leave at 12.40pm. Looked at the flight board with delays, etc. The flight, WOW 174 on scheduled for 12.40pm June 21 was delayed until 8.40pm. No emails or text or calls made by the airline to me or my agent. Called my agent to let her know as I was going to arrive too late for a $500 tour scheduled for 4 hours after arrival. This is when she got on the phone to find out what was going on as no one from WOW air was at Bradley Terminal to assist passengers at that time. My agent was on hold for one full hour with a lost connection at 60 minutes. Reconnected with WOW and on hold for yet another hour. Once she was connected, she found out not only was the flight delayed, but it was delayed until 11.10 or thereabouts with an explanation that the WOW takeoff runway somewhere in Great Britain was under an emergency that they had no control over. I got this information as I was standing on line to ""check in"" with other passengers who were unaware of the delay. People only found out about the delays as they approached to check in counter. Staff looked stressed but some were smiling and being very pleasant. However, no one from WOW made any announcement about the delay or offered any assistance to help passengers connect with other airlines so they could be on their way. Apparently, WOW has no relationship with other carriers to reduce the problem. I was given a refund promise through my agent who said WOW Customer service told me to ask for the refund at the check-in counter. That was denied. My agent spoke to the Business Agent by phone to let him know what WOW management had told her and he said he couldn't do that, but my agent persisted and they did the transaction right there and it should be processed in another few days. So I didn't get my vacation as planned. When I got home, there was delayed emails and the flight was delayed until 1.30 the following day.

I was traveling with a 14 month old child and there was no where in the terminal to nurse her. As boarding I was told to leave my baby stroller at the gate area and not the aircraft which I questioned. I was told for a second time to leave it by the gate and it would be taken down to the aircraft. The stroller did not make it to my final destination and I had no stroller for my baby. I was told it was left in BWI and now lost! I still do not have it and it is an expensive $350 stroller.  Next journey home. We left KEF about 20 mins late - not bad I was thinking. Then 30 minutes into our flight we had to turn around and come back to KEF due to a mechanical issue with the plane. We were deplaned and stuck in KEF for 4 hours. There was no communication from the ground staff during this delay and it was handled very poorly. The service desk was telling people individually about the situation, but no announcement was made to everyone in the gate/ terminal until the end when we were ready to board. Five minutes before boarding we were told to line up by the service desk and get a meal voucher for 1000 Icelandic Kroner. As soon as we lined up for the voucher the boarding announcement was made. There was only one person handing out the vouchers while others watched and it took forever. Once on the plane they started the food and beverage service. We were on row 11. When they got to me there was no food left! We were traveling with a 14 month old baby and there was no food for her on an almost 6 hour flight. She had not been able to eat all day with all the delays. KEF airport had no food for us to buy either with the fridge with the sandwiches totally emptied out and zero food available. Fortunately one flight attendant gave my daughter a small tray of fruit taken from her own crew meal. WOW needs to correct their SOP's - why does WOW have no regard for babies and young children? They should be offered food before anyone else. As people at the front eat just fine, while the rest of us had to wait until we got home. As there was no food left I was unable to use my 3,000 Kroner worth of vouchers for the three of us. We landed and guess what no stroller! For a second time. WOW had lost my first stroller so we were forced to buy a second when we were in the UK and now WOW lost the replacement also. So WOW managed to inconvenience me seriously on both flights. I obviously will not be traveling with this airline or using KEF as a transfer location ever again. It is no cheaper than other airlines when you factor in the high baggage and food costs. Just do yourself a favor and fly with another established airlines.",BWI to BRS via KEF,1,1,wow-air,such terrible service,Family Leisure,,1,1,3cda3892-8ed1-4576-8fbd-940472f99788

Online reviews we had read about were not positive, but we decided to try it when an excellent seat sale came up for May. Now we went in with 'low' expectations - we knew there would be no complimentary food, beverage, or entertainment. Well, we really enjoyed our experience (both segments) because of the following: 1) Our airplane was waiting for us at the gate when we arrived fairly early at Pearson Airport Toronto. 2) We boarded on schedule and in an orderly manner. 3) The flight crew were professional, friendly and spoke impeccable English. 4) The seating was not super spacious but was fine. 5) Our flight was smooth and we landed a little late but well within expectations. The return trip was the same experience: on-time, professional crew, smooth flight. Couple of additional comments: the food that was offered was pricey but that was expected and we brought our own food. The flight was over 5 hours both ways but we brought our own entertainment. The seating was 3 seats on either side of the aisle, which we were fine with. We flew direct, so did not have a connecting experience to share.

Put right to the back of the plane where we had a stewardess who spent most of her time sitting down texting on her phone and doing her expenses. The steward was more interested in eating a Snickers bar than doing anything else.

If you're used to carrying a lot of baggage, it may be the same price to go with another airline like IcelandAir, etc. We paid 98$ for two checked bags for each leg. - We were only able to get the cheap deal on the tickets by going to Wow's website and couldn't get a reasonable price having a connecting ticket from Chicago. In so, we had to buy separate RT tickets from Chicago to Boston incurring the risk that if there was enough of a flight delay we would eat the cost (I booked our flights into and out of Boston with almost a day of leeway, resulting in a lot of down time at the Boston Airport - it is not the greatest airport to have down time). Our tickets with United ran us 180 (or 160?), we would received two free checked bags with United since we're part of their loyalty program, so we chose to go with them for their second set of tickets despite their prices being slightly higher than the competition. - No inflight entertainment/wifi - utilize those power outlets! We had no issues with our flights to and from Boston to Reykjavik. I noticed upon booking our tickets that they only allow 1 carry on bag and that has to weigh 5 kg (11lbs) or less. Not your standard carry on bag and a ""personal item (laptop bag, purse, etc.), but you are allowed only 1 carry on bag. This is all listed on their website. You also have to pay for any checked bags. It is cheaper to pay for any additional bags (to be allowed to have a larger carry on, a checked bag, etc.) in advance (at least 24 hours) than at the counter. There were three of us (my husband, brother, and me) so we opted to pay for two checked bags between us, and we all just carried a simple bag between the three of us as our carry ons. When we were in line to check in on our flight from Boston to Reykjavik, we noticed that a huge issue most people had was not realizing they couldn't bring their standard carry-ons and checked bags without any additional fees (they would say, ""We always have done this with no issue!""). We only paid 99$ for our trip to Keflavik and 129$ for our flight back to Boston (we had bought return tickets with United to connect us from Chicago to Boston), so I think it's perfectly reasonable to pay extra for all of that other stuff.

As I didn’t find any available direct flights to Tenerife by the time of booking the tickets in April 2022. First, I booked a flight for 4 passengers from Bergen to Gdansk  with WizzAi, which is canceled by Wizzair after the planned departure time). I have booked one night in a hotel in Gdansk on 25/06/2022. Bought 4 tickets for the whole family with LOT Airlines from Gdansk to Warsaw in order to take another aircraft to Tenerife. Booked another 4 tickets from Warsaw to Tenerife through Wizz Air at the end. On the planned day we went to Bergen Airport. The departure time was at 14.05. We received a sms from Wizz Air  the flight is delayed and the estimated departure will be: 14.40, then another sms at 14.27 that the flight was delayed again and the new departure will be at 16.00, then another sms about a new delay to 16.30. At 14.47 they sent sms that the flight was canceled without mentioning the reason for cancellation. No one from WizzAir was in the airport to inform us what to do and no one called us. We went home with our kids again and tried to contact Wizz Air. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone with a paid phone call, they said that there are no other available flights, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried on my own to find another solution, and I found a flight at 22.40 to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car and drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife on the second day. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured me that everything is OK. I got the same confirmation number, I rented a car and paid online from Katowice Airport to drive with my family over the night to Warsaw as we did not find a hotel to accommodate us. We went to Bergen Airport again with our kids. The new boarding was at 22.40 on Saturday 25/06/2022, but they told us that the flight was delayed and then was also canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport, the same as for the first time. Just those from Bergen airport gave us a paper stating our rights and they said that Wizzair will contact us, but no one has contacted us. I called WizzAir again. They couldn't find any other alternative flights, and asked me to send them a claim to get a refund and any other expense that I lost due to the two cancellations. I received a SMS at 06.00 am that the flight was canceled. (7 hours after the scheduled departure time). As a result of that , we could not travel to Poland and we missed the hotel accommodation, the flight from Gdansk to Warsaw, the car rental fee in Katowice and on top of that we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife.

I checked-in in Paris where I was told I could carry my small carry on and back-pack for the flight. I had already paid the extra-kg required (ie. 12 kg) online when I booked the flight. Since my carry on was 10 kg, a very helpful  lady in Paris told me I was perfectly fine for the flight, meaning carrying these two pieces of luggage. To my surprise, when boarding in Reykjavik towards Baltimore two WOW air staff told me I could only take one piece with me in a very aggressive and impolite manner. I tried explaining the situation and the misinformation that apparently I’d received in Paris. I asked if I could pay just for the difference of checking-in one luggage and paying for extra kg for carry-on.  I was very rudely informed that this wasn’t possible. I ended up trying to fit everything in my small carry on, which I managed to do expect for the empty back-pack. WOW air staff didn’t let me take this empty back pack, and yet again in the most rude and offensive way I had seen before I was told I needed to pay. So, I ended up leaving behind a book and precious back pack. The behavior of staff was obnoxious, they were threatening with closing the flights. Two things I gathered from this unpleasant experience: Rules are not applied equally across airports/staff and passengers: all WOW air ground staff should be well informed about the airline rules. I am still not sure which is the right rule, however it is not fair for the passenger who is receiving misleading information. I was trying to collaborate and understand the rules without being ripped off. Moreover, I witnessed certain passengers boarding with two pieces without being stopped by the ground staff. I find this a discriminatory treatment.  During all my years flying around the world (including lowcost companies) I had never been treated with such disrespect and unprofessionalism. The staff in Reyjkavik didn’t want to tell me their names, otherwise I would have stated their full names here.

,WOW air,Economy Class,October 2015,4th October 2015,1,1,1,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"We flew 4 flights in a 10-day period on WOW Air. Overall, it was a severely disappointing experience with 3 of the 4 flights delayed by more than 2 hours. (The only explanation given each time was that the plane was delayed.) The flight out of Boston experienced a strange boarding experience, where half the plane was loaded, and then, inexplicably, they asked everyone to stop boarding and exit the plane. No staffers gave any explanation to the passengers, and all the passengers were stuck in a tiny holding area between the gate check-in desk and the jet bridge. After 20 minutes of waiting - still no explanation from any staffer. Only when we started boarding again and were on the plane did a flight attendant explain what happened. What horrible communication. That flight out of Boston was delayed 2 hours. The flight to London was on-time because it left in the morning. However, although told to arrive 2 hours before your flight, WOW Air only staffs its ticket counter with a single person early in the morning (4:45 am). At 5:10 am, 2 additional staffers came on to help out. That means WOW basically is okay with you waiting for nearly 30 minutes in line for no reason, since the one staffer obviously can't ticket an entire plane full of passengers. This was just poor service and communication - don't tell customers to arrive 2 hours early if you don't have staff until 90 minutes before the plane leaves. The flight back to Iceland from London was delayed 2 hours, again with no explanation. The flight back to Boston was delayed for 3 hours, with no explanation. The person at the ticket desk was rude and never apologized to us for the delay either. So 75 percent of our flights were late. And not just ""a little"" late - but 2 or 3 hours late (time spent in everyone's favorite place - the airport!). The flights were okay, except you are packed like sardines on the plane (very little leg room). Two of the four flights also experienced an odd landing. The first landing was fine, but then about halfway down the runway, the pilot slammed on the brakes and suddenly swerved right. No explanation was given by the pilot for this unusual behavior. The second flight (coming back into Boston) also experienced a similar unexpected, hard braking after landing. Again, with no explanation or apology by the pilot. Apparently some of the rules of WOW Air is to say as little as possible, offer no explanations, and don't apologize for their treatment of you. When I complained about one of these incidents to their twitter feed, they did apologize - but that's one of the few apologies I ever got from them. All in all, we flew WOW to give them a try (given their low airfares). They had 4 chances, and blew them all with us.

The fun part is, that they have no personnel at the airport and the numbers that the airport staff has, do not work either. So you can pay the fee or call the call center for just 2-3€ per minute.

Two weeks later, although the flight status right before leaving for the airport was green light, and the weather at both ends was fine, my Gatwick-Keflavik WOW flight was 2.5 hours late. I was connecting to an Icelandair flight to Boston, and was very skeptical when the WOW flight attendants told several people not to worry, that Icelandair would hold the plane. Of course they did not hold the plane, and I had to re-book for the next day's Icelandair flight. Change fee was $400, fare difference $60, but I also had to spend the night in the airport hotel plus eat a dismal dinner there. Total damage was about $700. WOW refused to compensate me since, while it was their fault that I missed the Icelandair flight, it was a different airline. Icelandair understandably refused to compensate me.

,WOW air,Economy Class,July 2015,14th July 2015,0,0,3,UnitedStates,5.0,yes,"You get what you pay for with Wow Air. Booking is pretty easy online. I was surprised when asked to choose my seat and that charges were added to my bill based on where I sat. I chose to sit in the cheap seats $5-$10 on each leg. When I boarded I really didn't see a whole lot of difference between my seat and the more expensive ones up front though there may have been a couple of inches difference. The plane was clean and the staff friendly. I didn't mind that there was no entertainment. I brought a good book and read or napped the whole way. I had chosen aisle seats but still felt claustrophobic when the passenger in front of me moved his seat back. It's tight! I had read that food was extra and expensive (they even charge for water) so I picked up something at Logan airport on the flight over to Denmark. The problem on the return to Boston was that I had barely 40 minutes between flights once I got off the plane in Reykjavik. I couldn't spend much time making selections or using the lady's room (fortunately only a short line). And it was a 15-20 minute walk to my gate in Iceland. Speaking of Iceland, the only flight from Boston to Copenhagen is overnight and also stops in Iceland at 4am. This layover, unlike the return, is 3 hours long and the entire airport is closed and practically deserted. Even my gate wasn't open. If any airline is going to drop off people in the middle of the night the airport should have something open-or better, cots set up so we can sleep. It's a long time at an awful hour to be sitting and waiting. Being able to have breakfast would be nice. My only big complaint on this trip was that Wow Air doesn't have a desk set up in Copenhagen airport until 2 hours before the flight. You cannot get a boarding pass online but must go to the gate. The line queues up fast and it's long as the flight is full. And here's the problem-having been in the EU for 2 weeks I wanted to get a tax refund. The system is already complicated and designed to discourage this. But since you need a boarding pass to get the customs stamp I had to wait for Wow Air to open a desk. Once you get your boarding pass you also give them your checked luggage. Customs want to see what you have bought, not just receipts, so be sure to have it all in your carry on luggage. People who get boarding passes ahead don't have this issue as they are still in possession of their checked luggage. Once you have the customs stamp you then have to find the correct bank/agency for the refund. There are several. All this takes time and waiting in line and then you still have to clear security. So I barely made my flight out of Copenhagen. It's stressful and shouldn't be. I was at the airport 3 hours before the flight hoping to take care of all of this.",Copenhagen to Boston via Rejkyavik,2,4,wow-air,WOW air customer review,Solo Leisure,,4,0,0573863e-09ab-4f71-bfab-2554ddf1b287

,WOW air,Economy Class,,5th May 2015,1,2,0,UnitedStates,5.0,no,Traveled from Copenhagen to Boston. WOW Airlines offer a good route for a very reasonable rate. I appreciate what the airline is trying to accomplish by offering discount rates across the Atlantic. But let's get real. For flights over 4-5 hours comfort entertainment and basic human needs are required. The aircraft from Copenhagen to Reykjavik was pretty shabby but got us safely to our destination. The aircraft from Reykjavik to Boston was very new however the seating was uncomfortable (for a flight of that length) there was no entertainment and of course the food and refreshments were not free. Not even water. On both legs the inflight staff did not seem very happy just not very pleasant at all. Lastly the customer service is troubling. There is very little opportunity to contact any service representative unless you are in the same time zone as Reykjavik. This makes it very difficult to make changes (after the 3 hour window closes) or cancellations to your purchases. The airline has potential and I expect they will work out the kinks. Unfortunately until then customers will bare the brunt of their mistakes.

If you need any deal of extra customer service expect nothing beyond standard email replies and frowns. Front desk agents not particularly happy to be there. As with all the low cost carriers this company tries to squeeze revenue from extra carry on and normal baggage fees.

,WOW air,Economy Class,,24th February 2015,1,3,0,UnitedKingdom,6.0,yes,WOW Air is a ok low cost airline and with some improvements (online check in boarding) would be a good efficient airline like easy jet but with a better cabin. The flights where dirt cheap at £300 for 3 people with 1 bag and reserved seats. Flight WW206 16/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft:TF-WOW. Check in opened at 16.10 for the 19.40 flight. It was quick and there where 3 check in staff. The flight was nearly full today which shows they are doing well. We have reserved seats which we did get and they did acknowledge that when we booked we had the 12kg hand luggage allowance. Boarding opened at 18.40 for the 19.40 flight and we went immediately to the gate. Boarding was chaotic as they where boarding in rows and people didn't listen causing delays. It was painful and needs to be improved lot be like the procedure at KEF. We pushed back at 20.00 (late) and we were off at 20.15. The flight was good with comfy seats with recline. The buy on board was cheap in comparison with Ryanair and the crew where professional but chatty (a good balance). We landed at 23.10 in a blizzard. KEF was unprepared and we had to wait for 2 0mins to attach the jetway. Baggage was also slow but this wasn't wow's fault. Good flight but poor ground services all in all. Flight WW201 20/2/15. LGW-KEF. Aircraft TF-WOW. Check in opened at 04.45 for all the morning flights (06.50-07.00-07.15). (Ours was at 07.00). Check in was quick and there were 5 staff for 3 flights which was OK. Our flight was also again nearly full. KEF airport is a good airport in terms of departures. We went to the gate at 06.00 and the gate area opened at 06.20. Boarding began at 06.30 and they just let everyone one which was easier. This time the plane was bang on time for pushback at 07.00 and was up at 07.07. The flight was yet again good with a cheap buy on board and yet again a drinks round and a tea or coffee round which is good in comparison with easy jet. The plane landed at 09.40 (15mins early) and we were off at 09.50 baggage handling however needs to be faster. No entertainment was available.

Check in opened 3hours and 30 mins before and a new hand luggage allowance has been out in place meaning passengers where getting nervous if the there bags would be fine. Wow air fail to provide online check in making it less of an attractive option. On today's flight wow air where 20mins late arriving and boarding was chaotic. They boarded in rows but nobody listened. We took off 35 mins late and the inflight experience was the same as easyjet. We saw the northern lights which was a plus but doesn't affect the airline's performance. The flight landed 20mins late in a blizzard but the pilot did a good job and landed smoothly. The crew where chatty but professional. Once arriving in KEF the jetway failed to attach on several attempts and we waited for 30mins before we could get off. Even worse we had to wait for another 30mins for our luggage meaning we left KEF at 00.25 instead of 23.30 not good. WOW AIR need improvement to its ground services before I can recommend it. However our return expirence may be better if not in a blizzard. The inflight was average for low cost travel.,,3,3,wow-air,WOW air customer review,,,3,0,04a9c511-5ff9-4f68-bbb2-acecaee94712

Our return flight (17/07/22) landed four hours late - adding a £30 additional cost to our transport home. The level of service was appalling. On the return journey no reason was given for the four hour delay. It can only have been a Wizz Air issue as a RyanAir Flight at 9.20 p.m. took off on the same route only 6 minutes late. On the outward journey the cabin crew were surly, rude and offensive. They refused to answer questions from multiple customers about the delay. They literally threw kitkats at customers when handing them out. One said openly to someone sitting behind us ... ""We are rude to the customers because they are rude to us."" Customers were not rude - they were only asking genuine questions. The service was the worst I have ever seen - not just when flying. Customers deserve better. I hear that most complaints are ignored. The problems were all with Wizz Air - no other flights had these lengths of delay. Communication was non-existent. There was no real attempt to explain or compensate customers.

We were in Dubrovnik airspace when the captain informed us that the weather conditions were bad and we circled the airport for 45 minutes before being diverted to Zagreb. We were informed by the captain that there would be a coach to take us to Dubrovnik airport which is a 600km drive (between 6-9hours!) Once we finally disembarked at Dubrovnik at around 10:30pm we were met by nobody, there wasn’t a representative from Wizz Air or anyone else, we were left for 75 minutes not knowing where to go or what to do. At 11:45pm a bunch of coaches arrived at which point mayhem ensued! People scrabbling it get on, and we could only hope that it was for Dubrovnik as the driver spoke no English. We arrived in Dubrovnik at 10:15am, over 14 hours later than it was due to arrive.

And then after an hour of waiting we were informed that the flight had been cancelled and to come forward for 4 euro voucher. Yes 4 euros for waiting 4 hours, one euro per hour! Sometime later we told there would be a coach to take us to a hotel. The message from Wizz Air was to rebook or get a refund as the next flight out wasn’t till Wednesday the 13th of July. I ended up having to book a ticket to Amsterdam and then on to Gatwick and finally a train back to Luton Airport. Which added 13 hours to the trip.

After 45 minutes waiting over the phone, they said that there's no other flights available, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund.

I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured that everything is OK. We went to the Bergen Airport again with our kids, and 5 minutes before the new boarding, they told us that the flight is delayed and then is canceled also without giving any reason.

My friend checked in about half an hour earlier but they kept a seat free next to him until I checked in which was great. Obviously being a LCC there's only buy on board stuff but crew was incredibly friendly funny and efficient. Oh and there's inflight entertainment showing a movie on the overhead screens. The A320 was leased from Air Bulgaria and still had their saftey card in the seat pocket but it was clean and quite comfortable with decent pitch and seat recline (contrary to other LCCs where it's more of a chicken farm experience).

Outbound LGW-KEF was on a nearly new Airbus A320 that was on loan from Air VIA but painted in WOW Air livery. Flight attendants were very friendly witty and generally fitting of the attitude that WOW Air wants. Check-in at Gatwick was a bit slow mainly because the four agents were weighing most hand luggage to ensure it was under the 10kg requirement. Onboard food seemed fine - had a ham and cheese baguette that was hot and tasty. Prices seemed reasonable. They had some good beer specials going and were more than happy to promote them! Overall experience was good - certainly better than anything I've experienced on RyanAir or EasyJet. The price was far better than Icelandair for my travel dates.

My flight was on a very old (25+ years) MD-83 owned by SwiftAir a Spanish charter airline with some scheduled service I believe. In all my years of flying I don't think I've ever been on a plane in worse condition inside. Ripped carpet tons of places where serious scrapes and dents had been painted over shabby seats loose interior panels and just a general level of dirt and grime etc. It was a huge contrast to the nearly new A320 on my outbound and really does a disservice to WOW Air because it felt entirely bargain-basement. Crew was half-WOW Air and half-Spanish and the Spanish side was fine but rather brusque. No in-flight entertainment. Check-in was pretty slow - about 100 people in line maybe 8 agents. They moved quickly but still a fair bit of waiting. I'd recommend WOW Air as I'm sure that this plane won't be around long.

We had just flown into Milan from New York and we were connecting to Cagliari, Sardinia in April 2022. We were sure to have our bags the allotted and accepted sizes. When we went to the Check-in Desk, the woman at the check-in in Milan said that we needed to purchase our boarding passes. She further stated that two of our bags were not compliant when indeed there were others identical that went through without being charged an extra hundred dollars. The folks traveling with us are 80 years old, one with a cane, and this woman showed no compassion. Because my phone was in airplane mode on the flight right before this, I was unable to check in within 3 hours prior to this flight. I had my tickets and barcode on my phone. She gave us two little pieces of paper and we had to go to this kiosk and wait 15 minutes in line to purchase two more boarding passes. We had purchased these tickets through e-Dreams where each time I purchased a ticket, the price went up. I paid an extra $125 for two more boarding passes. I was about to pay for my personal ticket but then I thought, I am going to go straight to the line and not go through that woman because I have my ticket. That worked for me, but the elderly couple were extremely distraught and upset over this experience. I ended up ordering two new tickets for them for the return trip. I double-ordered because I did not want to get saddled with another boarding pass fee. I did not use e-Dreams either this time and that helped. I contacted Customer Support a I do not like to write negative reviews, but they kept giving me the run-around.

They present a low priced ticket to snipe your attention and your money, then once you’ve committed your purchase, they add on all of the extras. Do you  want to sit with your young child? They’ll charge you for that. Do you want to carry a bag with you larger than a computer case? They’ll charge you for that. Did you want to check in for your flight somehow? They’ll charge you for that (they even charge for online check in). You get a cheap price up front until they secure your business, but once they have it, the stack on the extra fees until your ticket price becomes comparable to an actual reputable airline. You will not be able to fly without paying extra fees. Because I didn’t check in online the day before (because you know, I have things to do before I go on vacation) they charged me an extra $150 dollars just to do a regular check in. Then, because I had a cabin-sized bag and a camera bag, they charged me an extra $25 for that. Then because I didn’t pay for assigned seats they actually sat my four year old child away from us. They had it on record that he was four years old and their seating arrangement came up with that! Can you believe it? Sure we could switch it around so he wasn’t unaccompanied, but they were perfectly fine with separating the child from his family because a fee wasn’t paid. That’s a pretty gross business practice and I almost wonder if it was intentional because a fee wasn’t paid. For real. This becomes a moral and ethical issue when they will make a child sit alone unless you pay an extra fee for seating. It’s actually a disgusting business model and I will never fly this deceptive airline again. Just pay the extra money for a more reputable airline instead of this sneaky nonsense that Wizz Air pulls on its clients. So what is Wizz Air prioritizing? Cheap shot fees over customer service and satisfaction. DO NOT book this airline because it looks like a deal. It is not a good deal.

First, I received my boarding pass on my phone prior to arrival at the airport and didn't need to check any baggage, so I went straight through security and into the airport. Budapest airport doesn't announce the gate for your flight until about 30 minutes prior to check-in closing, so I waited around for a while.

Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. ""Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers – regardless of origin – are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection."" - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return.

When I raised this issue with members of the crew, they shrugged me off and told me that there is nothing they can do about it and that I should sort this issue. I do not believe that it is the job of passengers to enforce basic covid safety rules, and I also believe that the airline has a duty of care towards all its passengers. The incident made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe during the entire duration of the flight. Moreover, I noticed that during the entire duration of the flight, no member of the flight crew took any measure or said anything towards other rule infringing passengers, not even when passengers without masks were passing by them on the corridor. I find this to be unacceptable, for a member of the flight crew to pass multiple infringing passengers on the corridor and not do even as much as ask them to follow international guidelines and regulations regarding safety during the Covid Pandemic. I am very disappointed in this and will think twice from now on about flying or recommending WizzAir to others.",Luton to Cluj,1,1,wizz-air,lack of action towards enforcing Covid safety,Couple Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,8cffb3d6-920c-4b1f-9e7f-72de572037a9

But alas, the airline has changed! Now it feels that they are solving their cash flow problems by allowing new booking only to cancel them later, often “at the last minute” (a few hours before the flight). My flights to Moscow in June 2021 were cancelled twice, second time I was already in a hotel near the airport as the flight was very early morning, so had to come in the ending. So I lost money on transport, COVID test and hotel. My friends flight to St Petersburg was also cancelled, she opted for a refund which is promised in 30 days… Good luck with that. When they cancel the flight, they offer refund or re-book, but refund only for “new” money, not if your used credit accumulated with them during pandemic for the past cancelled flights… so I had to re-book. And since then my booking was cancelled or amended three more times within 2 days. Dates get pushed further and further away from originally booked flights, like a month and a half later. I checked availability on site prior rebooking and noticed that tickets price is 3-4 times higher than mine… so my guess is that my booking is being bumped off as they sell tickets for much higher price! Or may be they don’t intend to fly at all, just collect new payments anyway to save themselves…. In addition some add-on services are NOT refundable as it turned out, specifically “provided by partners”. Once after cancellation and request to add credit to the account I discovered that around £18 “disappeared” without explanation. I’m not sure what “service” was deducted.

Note that the Wizz Air online check-in closes 3 hours before departure! 2) To not pay for the check-in, according to the Wizz Air website, is possible at the airport by using the self-service check-in, and if those are not available at the traditional check-in desk. 3) However, this is not the case. At Milan Malpensa Terminal 1 on Friday, and at Vienna Terminal 3 on Sunday (today), there was no self-service check-in available (I confirmed this with the available check-in staff), and the traditional check-in counter would only check us in if we paid €15/person. 4) This is not all, at MXP the payment is handled by another desk which charges a €5/person commission and at VIE the commission is €5/transaction. So when you book with Wizz Air you need on paying at least €7-8 for the check-in online, or €15 if you do so at the airport plus €5 commission. This is not an optional extra service!

I paid for 10KG luggage I didn’t actually need. I thought I was signing up for priority but to be honest I did the booking quickly and didn’t read everything. Trick is to read very carefully regarding the numerous add on options. I only had a really small bag so didn’t need that add on at all. What I should have done was chose my seating at the time of booking. I waited till after and it ended up costing me more. No doubt about it, their software will stick you in a middle seat, probably far away form anyone else in the booking. Trick is to select your seat at the time of Booking.

The Greek Government  said that direct flights from the UK to Greece would continue to not be permitted from 1 July (they were not permitted during June, and they were thinking of allowing them from 1st July onwards, but changed their minds, and first announced that on 26th June). He also said that the official announcement was going to come out on 29th June. I didn't want to wait till 1 day before my flight for WizzAir to cancel it (and I found out from others that they ended up cancelling it on the 30th and a mere 14 hours before the actual flight), thus I tried to book another flight. In that effort, I ended up cancelling my ticket which led to the first ridiculous policy they have - it takes 72 hours for them to put the ""refunded"" money into a ""Wizz Air account"", why 72 hours? The second ridiculous policy is that after they added it I would only have 3 months to book another flight with them, otherwise they keep the money, which is ridiculously short even for pre-COVID times, it should be 12 months at least, and probably 24 or 36 now that COVID is around. I would have found that reasonable. But regardless, I couldn't wait 72 hours to book another flight with them, so I ended up booking with another company for my actual flight. Once the 72 hours passed, my money was added to the ""Wizz Air Account"", after which I proceeded to try to get a refund to one of my actual bank accounts. In that process, they ask for the reason for the refund, and they have two new options ""Cancellation initiated by Wizz Air due to COVID"" and ""Cancellation initiated by customer due to COVID"" - I picked the second option, assuming that there is a difference from a similar cancellation pre-COVID times, and thus that I would actually get a refund (otherwise what's the point of having such an option). Apparently, cancelling my flight due to COVID (a flight which was gonna get cancelled for sure by them eventually) and having bought the more expensive ticket wasn't enough to get a refund.

The flight was scheduled for 19 May 2020. Given the worldwide pandemic crisis, lockdown restrictions were set in place by the government of Romania and UK. As such, I called WizzAir customer service at the beginning of April 2020 to enquire about the flight status. I was advised that the flight was still going ahead as planned and that passengers will be informed about cancellations due to Covid19 via email (when applicable). When I asked about the notice period I was informed there is not a set notice period and it could vary from 2 weeks to next-day cancellation notice. WizzAir personnel advised me not to cancel my booking as yet and wait for further communication closer to the flight date, and that if I still wanted to cancel the flights due to the Covid19 pandemic and further restrictions inposed by government then I should do so 14 days prior to flight date to ensure I am not charged additional cancellation fees. I called customer service again on the 1st of May 2020 and I was advised the flight is still going ahead as scheduled and if I wanted to cancel the flights WizzAir will charge 60 Euros/person/flight. This is unacceptable considering the current worldwide situation, and more specifically the restrictions imposed by the government. The UK is under lockdown with no end date in sight (at the point of this complaint), which means all non-essential travel is not permitted. Additionally, social distancing restrictions are further imposed by the Romanian Government and the UK government, including 2 meters distance between people. These measures were not respected. As such, the flight should have been cancelled, in line with government guidelines. It is not acceptable for a company not to adhere to Government guidelines and put customers at risk. I find it appalling that flights are not cancelled in advance by WizzAir (given specific lockdown instructions set by the government) and that passengers are required to cancel the flights more than 14 days prior to the flight so that the cancellation fees are not increased. It is absurd to charge the cancellation fee per person per flight and not per booking, meaning that the customer receives a 10th of the price paid. Based on the information I received from the WizzAir staff, the flight cancellation period varies from 2 weeks to 1 day. This means WizzAir deliberately does not adhere to WHO and Government (country specific) guidelines and restrictions, so that they can retain most of the price paid by customers when booking flights. Aside from this blatant disregard for pandemic restrictions, the customer service personnel was rude and dismissive over the phone, with no willingness to discuss the options available for customers.

The size of the hand luggage is ludicrously small for one piece. When booking I bought the extra size. I was then annoyed to see at the check in those who had larger than the allowed size were being let through without having to pay more, some had two or three bags. The staff were mentioning it was too big to some but letting them through anyway, some they were charging. If the policy is to allow bigger bags fair enough but what is really unfair is my bag was only slightly bigger than the allowed size, so why did others not have to pay for bigger and I did? (I took pictures to prove it). I complained about this via the form on the website and the response had nothing to do with the complaint. I replied saying this and they said it was too late now. Their number is really hard to find but I called and was told I would be transferred, I was put on hold for 20 minutes and then they cut me off. I called back, no apology, I was told someone would call me back that day, a week later nothing. I left messages on twitter, they ignored them – although they “liked” a reply to one of my messages which suggested I called them again, so they were aware but not bothered to try and resolve it. I kept on leaving messages on twitter, eventually they told me to call the number I originally, although that was a battle to get it from them. I called and was told no one on that number could help and as for the lack of service he wouldn’t apologise “as it was nothing to do with him”. He didn’t listen to what I was saying but eventually said he would escalate it and I would get an email – which is rubbish by this point. Over a week later nothing. I am now far more angry about the way they deal with their customers, they seem to want to aggravate them, rather than resolve issues.

At first thought it was a good airline and no complaints but now seems to be going down hill very rapidly. Airline staff good but check in staff rude and customer services absolutely appalling. Had so many issues this year so far and it’s only February. I know all airlines reschedule flights but we’ve had six flights changed already and it was an absolute nightmare trying to rebook them. The app wouldn’t let us book and customer services were rude and unhelpful. Took us many attempts speaking to different customers services operators to get it done. We also had to change our parking at the airport which we’d booked with Wizz and ended up being out of pocket by £80 but as Wizz said to us that is not their problem. They just don’t care. After all that stress and having to change leave at work I have now just had another email from them telling me they’ve rescheduled the flights all over again and on top of that I’ve just spoken to customer services and they’re saying I haven’t paid for one of my flights which is untrue.

It wouldn't allow us and told us to go to their website. We then went to the website and tried to check in and we had issues again. Got a message saying that there was a disruption to the flight. So we printed out all our documents and went to the airport and told them we had issues checking in online using their app and website they told us we had to pay 35 euros to check in at the airport. We told them there was an issue with their system and it wasn't our fault. They forced us to pay the additional 70 euros. Ended up being the most expensive flight for us. There was another 30 odd people who found themselves in this same situation on this flight and were requested to pay 35 euros.

Despite all the bad reviews, I had a wonderful experience with them. I had the Light “plan” selected with Wizz Priority added. I had no issues or whatsoever regarding my cabin luggage (did not have any checked-in baggage), the process at the gate went smoothly and very quickly (might be worth mentioning that on both outbound and return flights, the gate opened with a delay but regardless, everything went pretty fast afterwards). You only get priority when boarding the bus and at the gate, when they do the check-in, not when boarding the aeroplane like one may think. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful, the outbound flight was extremely smooth, no turbulences at all, the returning one had a few moments where it was slightly shaky. Yet, it was all good. The online check-in process was very easy. Be aware that if you do not check-in online, you pay a fee for the airport check-in. As for the luggage again, they even let this woman with a bag that clearly exceeded their dimensions limit in the cabin. Maybe she got lucky. Overall, I would fly Wizz again and I will in December, the same route. Absolutely love it. No “hidden” or “extra” fees as long as you read their rules carefully.

It was a funnel effect of a large mass of people trying to jam in to one small entry line with no direction from surrounding staff who were simply standing there. Nobody was taking initiative. I asked a staff member where exactly we should be queuing for our flight and she directed us to 3 counters further down. We waited in the queue for half an hour. Then a different staff member asked if I was priority. I said no. She said I need to move to the next line. Turns out two lines are standard and one is priority however we weren’t told that and the priority line was written in small writing at the front counter at the bottom of the screen. After this staff member turned several people to the correct queue I suggested to her she could go through the very large line and check with people before they spend half hour in the line only to get to her and be told it’s the wrong line. She did this and subsequently 80% of the line had to move as they were also told the wrong thing. There were a lot of angry people. We then queued for another half hour in the right line only to get to the counter and the boy behind the counter to say he could not check me in. Because I hadn’t checked in online. When in actual fact my partner who booked my ticket with his on the same booking could not book me in online. He tried several times but the website seemed to not allow it. This was an IT issue not our fault however we were being penalised by being made to now pay for a ticket to be issued. We were sent to a different desk. The guy changed some things in the system. He said due to booking through an external booking provider it causes glitches in the system and I was not in my partners booking despite having a confirmation email and having paid for my ticket. He said next time to book direct.

Every flight I have taken has been delayed to some extent: the shortest delay I can recall was of 20 minutes the longest was of about 2.5 hours. My flight on 2nd July was delayed by 1.5 hours. Wizz Air has used a variety of excuses when apologising in the aircraft for the delay in taking-off and arrival so it's not even worth repeating them. There is no point passengers and potential passengers trying to identify the reasons why this company seems incapable of taking-off and landing at the correct time, particularly on certain routes and particularly from Luton. The cabin crew on all my flights have been polite and professional but they too have seemed jaded and worn-down by the lack of on-time performance after all, a flight that lands at 2.30am (instead of at the scheduled midnight) means a very late arrival home for the crew as well. The standard crew comment that ""this is aviation and you have to expect such things"" is now becoming the company's mantra.

When it finally did, the number was accompanied already by a flashing ""BOARDING"" sign which put pressure on us. The gate was A17 so we followed the signs and at one point the signs indicated a direction for gates A12 - A19. Here it's when I noticed, on the side, a Wizzair staff screaming something which I could not understand so I went to her asking what is that she was saying and she was extremely rude and basically shoved us (not indicated) to another Wizzair staff (would have not been easier to put a sign akin to ""A12 to A19 except Wizzair passengers"" rather than having that rude woman screaming?"". So we went to this other person, this time a man who was checking the boarding passes and the size of the backbags without ever lifting his head and with the utmost scary expression. He sent me on one queue while my friends to another. When I asked him why, even though we were on the same flight, he sent us on two different queues, his brusque reply was: ""There is a difference, just go"".

Two hours after landing there, we were told that we were being returned to Luton and there was no other option. There was no reason for this redirection all that way except that the airline knew they needed the plane in the morning for other flights, and lied to the passengers about the reason.

A320,Wizz Air,Economy Class,October 2018,1st November 2018,1,1,4,UnitedKingdom,2.0,no,"Today, I had THE worst experience of my life on Wizz Air. I arrived early for boarding so that I could find room for my backpack in the overhead compartment - which I did. I then took my row 'C' aisle seat. After boarding was completed, I was made to remove my backpack by the stewardess and force it under the seat in front of me. My backpack is large, flexible and within Wizz Air's size limits, but placing it there meant that there was no room left for my feet. (See photos). I could not place my feet outside in the corridor area, either as it would have tripped other passengers who were walking and blocked the food trolleys. I had no choice but to place my feet under the metal braces in the seat in front, meaning that every time the passenger in front moved in his seat, my foot would get crushed. By the end of the flight my foot was bruised, and I was in pain, simply because my bag was too large to fit under the seat, and it should have been left in the over head compartment. Upon pointing this to the stewardess who instigated this episode without any consideration of the consequences, she told me to write to Wizz Air and complain, and that there was nothing she could do. It may be that Wizz Air will read this and decide to reply, stating that shortly larger bags, such as the one which I had to remove mine for will not be allowed without an extra fee. However, that is not the point. At the time of my journey, this was allowed, and. Wizz Air provided zero safe foot space. My bag was also too large to fit under the seat in front, and should have stayed in the overhead locker. Additionally, as my bag was too large to fit the seat in front, it was blocking the emergency escape route of the passengers sitting in the window and middle rows. This is dangerous, and I believe against passenger air transport safety rules. There were also a couple of other, issues regarding hygiene. I noticed that the toilets were cleaned by cabin crew, without wearing gloves, using paper towels from inside of the toilets. First the seat was wiped, then the sink and finally the same towel was dropped on the floor and the floor was wiped using the shoes. The stewardess then pick up the papers from the floor using her hands and flushed them down the toilet. After this, and without washing her hand, she walked to the food trolley and started serving food to passengers, touching coffee cups, water bottles, serviettes and sandwich wrappers. This has to be the worst case of hygiene which I have ever come across, and I would not trust any food served on this airline. I also noticed that the headrests on the seats had grease marks on them, as the paper headrests were missing. The Velcro exists to hang the headrests from, but in order to save costs, it seems like Wizz Air have decided not to care about this item either. I have travelled on Wizz Air on numerous occasions in the last 10 years or so (about 10 times this year alone), however the service has reduced dramatically, the prices have any rocketed (they are often more expensive than national carrier National carriers) and the staff's attitude to customers is simply atrocious - possibly due to their fast expansion. Because of a staff members attitude, the poor and dirty hygiene, over crowding, and bad value for money, I will not travel on Wizz any more, and I recommend that you check the prices of other airlines before booking with Wizz Air.",Warsaw to London,2,1,wizz-air,bad value for money,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,2,1,750df282-f9fe-4e78-ab1c-3a047c041b91

Then, also before boarding, they labeled the cabin luggage randomly and by force: I told them that I want to take with me in the cabin and that it was very small luggage, below the maximum limits for cabin luggage. They didn't care and lied that it will not necessary go to drop off, the flight attendant will hold them only if there will be no more space in the cabin. It was a lie because we were among the first to board and they took the luggage to the drop off. The places for luggage in the cabin were almost empty near our seats, so it was only mockery what they did. Besides that we had to wait at 3:30am half an hour for the luggage. Another problem is that the space in the seat is too small. I have 1.7 meters height and I stood with my knees stuck in the front seat. I cannot imagine how taller persons can fly 3 hours in that tiny place. Conclusion: never, ever flight with this joke of company, they have the absolute worst service I ever experienced.

My friend requires assistance on and off the aircraft. The airport staff were fantastic but the airline insisted that he must sit at the back of the aircraft in a centre seat despite the fact that he had paid priority with an extra leg room seat. The priority boarding at Luton and Larnaca was an absolute insult to intelligence. 5 lanes of check in for standard fare and one lane for priority. The entire flight was checked in before the priority queue had moved. Priority boarding is only priority through the gate and not boarding the aircraft. My friend ended up foregoing any assistance to board the aircraft In order to keep his extra leg room seat as he would have been in a great deal of discomfort over a 4 hour flight.

During that time we were on the plane for four hours, during which time a passenger deplaned for ""family"" reasons, an extensive security check was done on belongings in the plane, more passengers wanted to deplane (apparently scared by the extensive security check) and then everyone had to deplane. We were hardly instructed on where to go on the way back to the terminal, ""go up the stairs"", and given no prior instructions on how re-boarding was to take place.

After missing dinner and not drinking for hours, I needed to sit down and try to cancel my Madrid hostel reservation online. Then much earlier than expected I heard an announcement. That was the only boarding announcement although two authorized agents stated that ""many"" were given. It didn't look like any information was given on the screens.

Also checked in on line to ensure a trouble free departure and booked our cab to arrive early so we could get through and enjoy a coffee while we waited for departure.  So you would thing I did everything right? How wrong was I! On arrival at the Wizz Air check in, the queue was several hundred passengers deep, I pointed out to an official that all we needed to do was check in 1 bag ""join the queue"" was the terse reply. 55 minutes later, we finally arrived at the check in to be told that our on line check in did not apply, and we had to go the whole procedure again. Wizz Air did not have have enough staff at the check in counters. While 12 desks were ""open"" only 6 were manned....absolutely pathetic service. The end result was a rush to the departure gate, only to find that everyone was ""herded"" into a departure lounge that had seating for less than 10% of passengers. Priority boarding passengers were lined up outside the terminal and had to wait in the hot sun (it was an unusually warm English day) while the delayed incoming aircraft was refueled, resulting in several having to force their way back through the queue to get some shade. Altogether a complete shambles. What about the flight I hear you say! The cabin crew were awesome, friendly and helpful. The flight itself was what you would expect from a budget airline, skinny back uncomfortable seats, no in flight entertainment despite a 3 hour flight and of course you have to pay extra for all food and drink. All is not lost though!

,Wizz Air,Economy Class,July 2018,5th July 2018,1,1,1,UnitedStates,1.0,no,"Vienna to Rome. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. Here are 3 reasons why: 1) They Charge you for everything. I mean everything. If you don’t have checkin completed before you get to the airport it costs $40 to get one there so you can fly (not an exaggeration). Printing the little piece of paper costs literally as much as the airplane ticket. In addition, there website is so sneaky and tricky that they won’t send an email asking you to confirm or anything. They will make it incredible you difficult to do so they can steal some more money. I had 5 different flights on this trip from several airlines and this was the only one I could not figure out how to check in and spend $40 on that. Also expect to get charged extra if you have any extra bags at all: purse, hand bag, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if you got charged for entering the plane with gum in your mouth. 2) Staff will treat you poorly. Aside from being charged for everything and nit pick on everything there is no management in the building to talk to if you have an issue b/c the company is so small they have to hire an outside source at the airport. The staff treats you like criminals checking everything and looking for any little thing they can charge you with. From there you’ll be driven on a bus shuttle to the plane. Literally they are some stingy that you have to sit in the back of the bus if you are not priority. This doesn’t even matter, but it’s just that type of scroungy feel to the whole experience that makes it misserable. 3) They delayed the flight twice overall. I’ve flown about probably 10 or 15 times to places all over the world. I have had some great ones and some rough ones, but this is by far the worst. I will probably never fly with Wizz Air again and I encourage anyone else reading this review to do the same.

Like we have not got jobs to go to. I have complained directly to them to claim the european inconvenience payment of €400 per person and they claimed 'extraordinary circumstances' in both situations. We went through a law firm and they managed to get our payment for both cases. Recently, they have also changed the luggage on board rules and supposedly, they take all small hand suitcases to hold. We boarded the plane among the first 10 people and our suitcase was taken to hold. There were at least 30 suitcases (we counted, and we stopped counting after a while) which were taken on board after we boarded. So what is this s#1t? If only a certain number of suitcases are allowed on board, why don't they offer to allow people to check their hand luggage in advance? The staff have always been incredibly condescending and there seems to be a lack of training across the company as we have always been given contradicting explanations for the concerns we have raised.

I noticed at home when I reviewed our ticketing information was that no seats were assigned. So I went online and discovered that to select seats you had to pay for any seat on the plane. Since it was only a bit over an hour flight we decided to let them randomly select our seats even if the three of us, including our 12 year old daughter, were not seated together. A few days before the flight I again went online and attempted to check in. The first section of check-in covered two items: the need to pay to have even one bag checked in (at the rate of $50 per bag) and their rule that there was no guarantee that you could even take one carry-on unless you were willing to pay $6 Euros per passenger for a pass - which supposedly also allowed you to board early. Since we had three bags to check-in and three bags to carry-on I paid over $170 online in order to avoid paying a higher price (as noted in the online check out info) at the airport. The next section of the online check in asked me to select our seats - again at a price. Already upset at the outrageous check-in bag cost I opted not to select a seat and the web site booted me out. I assumed I would just check-in at the airport counter and find out what seats were assigned to us by the airlines. Imagine our surprise when we were informed by the clerk at the counter that we had failed to complete the check-in process and therefore he could not issue tickets. He directed us to another Wizz Air counter down the hall where we were told that our failure to complete the online check-in process would cost us 40 Euro per passenger (120 Euros total) - we had no other option but to pay the 120 Euros. We then returned to the ticket counter and finished checking in. When we arrived at the gate we discovered that the $6 Euro pass we had purchased for each of us allowed us to board early - ya, right, on the bus which then took us to the plane. We stood in the bus for over 30 minutes waiting to be taken to the plane. Once the bus arrived it was a mad house getting off the bus and trying to board the plane. We noticed that most of the other passengers had brought not one but two carry-ons with them. We could have avoided paying the $50/bag cost of checking in our three bags. Nothing but scams on the Wizz Air website. When we arrived in Bucharest we discovered that our large checked-in bag had one of its four wheels removed.

While on holiday I got an automated text from Wizz Air saying my flight had been changed and I would have got an email with my new flight details. There was no email, and my account showed I was still on the same flight. Looking on Facebook, a lot of people had this issue and Wizz Air admitted (on Facebook, where not many people would check) that the text was sent in error. This is after lots of people (according to their comments on Facebook) spent lots of money calling their premium number to check what happened to their flight (many waiting upwards of half an hour and many not even getting through!). I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane.

Bad service turned it into a very expensive (and frustrating) experience for me and my family! I traveled with my wife and two children to Romania, and we were denied boarding at the gate of the flight back from Bucharest to Israel, because of overbooking. No matter how much we argued and insisted, we were refused. I must emphasized that at any stage there was no call for volunteers to give up boarding, as the EU regulation require in case of overbooked flights, before performing involuntary denial of boarding. The staff member at the gate told us that they are missing one seat, so 3 of us can travel. We explained that we cannot split. Only after we got back to the ticket office at the departure flights counters we were told that we are entitled only for a single denied boarding, as the 3 others had seats and chose not to fly. We had to buy new flight tickets for the next day in a different airline, as Wizz Air had no seats available in the following days. These one way tickets cost us more than the entire round trip with Wizz Air (although it was with another low cost airline). We had to pay for hotel another night, meals, transportation etc. I submitted a complaint and sent copies of all required documents and receipts. It took more than a month for Wizz Air customer service to respond, and their feedback is that they are willing to compensate me for denied boarding of only a single passenger. They provided very limited compensation for the other passengers. The overall compensation Wizz Air agreed for is €984, while my overall expenses caused by this denial of boarding was €2,426. Seriously, Wizz? We know that airlines overbook the flights, but compensate properly your customers when they are harmed by it! At least reimburse the actual extra expenses caused, I am not even talking about compensation for the frustration and trouble. Follow the regulations and ask for volunteers before you perform involuntary denial of boarding! Don’t split up families! If you deny boarding from a member of a family under a single reservation, compensate the entire family! None of us wanted to stay there. The youngest kid was crying, we all wanted to get home already, we had good reason that we explained that prevented us from splitting. Beware of Wizz Air.

If you don't want to pay extra you can only carry a small bag at this airline, but they make that very clear even in their advertisement, so it can hardly be a surprise for anyone. What is more annoying is that you cannot choose seats at check in without having to pay extra. Consequently I was placed in a middle seat, even though the aircraft was only half full. But the person next to me moved away quickly so I could move to the aisle seat.

To start, the price as advertised was impossible. I'm used to surcharges - but they've even invented a difference between small and large cabin luggage, effectively forcing you to buy some additional luggage, even for weekend trips. Added costs not only for checked-in luggage - for for the usual cabin bag. Next, check-in. I arrive at Billund, there are no check-in machines. Arriving at the check-in counter (where the three couples before me in the queue were all shown off for having too large luggage), I am told that if they are to check me in (I did not do it online, I never do, but I am not late or anything), it will be an extra cost. Nothing had been mentioned about this in emails from Wizz Air. At both the check-in counter and the ticket office, where I am sent, they refuse responsibility in the usual weak agency manner, we're not Wizz Air, we're just airport reps. The final cost for checking in two hours before is DKK 270 (incl 30 in airport fee) - around 25% extra on the ticket price. It will be the same again, if I don't check in on the return leg. The feeling that they will milk you for every surcharge they can is pervasive. Inside the flight, the leg space is the narrowest I've experienced, even on low cost airlines, and the airplane is just generally dirty. The staff service was courteous, although of course food and drinks must be paid for.

In all the years I've travelled this route there was 1 (one) serious delay (over one hour), all other departures were roughly on time and arrivals often well ahead of scheduled time. The bottom line with Wizz is a simple one - you should be well prepared for all aspects of your trip and strictly adhere to their luggage/boarding pass rules (which seem to cause the most confusion but are all readily available to consult on their website in many languages) and you'll have absolutely no hassle. Measure your luggage by dimension and weight and, if in doubt, purchase it online, don't leave it for the airport. Always print your own paper boarding pass.

I'm writing to complain about the ridiculous business model of this airline. Our outbound flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, which shifted our plans around which meant we had to cancel one hotel, book another, and meant we paid for an extra day of our car rental that we didn't need. However this delay did not qualify for any compensation from the airline. On the inbound flight, we tried checking in online on our way to the airport, like many reasonable people do - but found out they have created an arbitrary window that if you check in less than 3 hours before your flight, you have to pay 35 euros per person. So in summary, Wizz Air delaying our flight and making us have to re-arrange hotels and our plans for the first day of our trip means they owe us nothing, but if I try to do something as basic as check in for the flight I already paid for, I have to pay an additional 35 Euro (70 Euro for my girlfriend and I together). On top of that, if you want to call them to complain about it, they charge you 1.3 Euros/minutes. The whole business model is a scam, it just aggravates consumers to be absolutely robbed at every stage of the journey.

This is a low cost carrier and this review is based upon the understanding that you know what that means and my ratings would be lower if it was a full service airline. Having said that I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Wizz Air again. Their website makes it clear what you get with a barebones ticket. A seat and small cabin luggage. Want anything beyond that and you have to pay for it. We actually went for added check-in luggage and as this was partially a shopping trip, more allowance on the way back from Budapest. You do need to make sure you understand that 30 days in advance you can check-in for your flight. That's when you should as that will give you the best options when picking your seats. We didn't get this so had to make do with somewhat less than optional seating, but it worked out in our favour actually. So this is a late afternoon flight out of Iceland. Check-in was efficient, but when we entered the terminal many food options had closed. As it turned out when flying to Budapest so had most of the food on the plane. The plane felt new and shiny. Seats OK, you can't lean back at all. This is actually somewhat better as I found it easier to get in and out of the seatrow.

The airport of Budapest seems to be constantly under construction. We were ushered into a hangar where, at the entrance, there was a member of staff checking our tickets. They would look at your suitcase and your boarding pass, and if they didn't like what they saw, they would confiscate your boarding pass and give it to another member of staff. A group of about 5-10 of us were set aside. There, you were asked to measure your bag by putting into the bag size checker. My suitcase would fit perfectly but it was about 5cm too tall. The staff then used a measuring tape (I'm not kidding) to highlight that my bag was 5cm above their 42x32x25cm requirements for a free small cabin bag. I was travelling with my wife. She has a bigger suitcase than me, so I had paid extra for her luggage, but not for mine which is significantly smaller. Despite me telling them repeatedly that I have never paid extra with other low cost airlines such as Ryanair for either my wife's or my suitcase, that this was a daylight robbery, that I had paid for one bag already, that my suitcase did fit into their size checker, that this was very poor customer service on their behalf - they did not budge. I had to pay 45 euros to take my suitcase with me. I was appalled by this. If 5cm is worth more to them than gaining loyal customers I will not choose to fly with them ever again.

This is when we found out that the plane never departed from Wroclaw (it was supposed to fly to Birmingham then back) and the flight is being cancelled. Not from the people that were supposed to help us or give out information. My dad gave them a call in Poland as the flight was long cancelled to find out that the plane has a technical issue.  All of the passengers had to go through a single service desk. 200 people. 1 desk! The Wizz Air customer service representative loudly exclaimed that he is not going to deal with anyone and will go home if people do not stop asking questions without waiting in line. It was around midnight already and many people did not not know what was going on, lots of them had no way to get home at this hour. Customer service was horrible, they just gave out ""your rights"" forms with a grumpy look on their faces without answering questions. We had the right to reschedule a flight to some other airport at the closest possible date. Wizz Air is supposed to provide shelter, food and transport in these cases. Do you think they did any of that? They don't care about their customers. When I asked them about it they told me to file a complain online. If it wasn't for kind people passing on information between each other, lots of them would not know what was going on. Luckily I came to the airport with my car, so I was able to book a flight at Luton next morning. What about all these people that did not have an option like that? When I got into the car I called the customer service quoting my rights and asking for help regarding my car park and dealing with the cancellation. The guy I called had no clue what to do in situations like these, he was no help at all. I hang up in anger as they charge ridiculous amounts for the calls.  I left the car park, booked another one at Luton and rushed home because the morning flight was at 9am. Thats when I found out that I had a return flight booked back to Birmingham. I called them to get this flight changed as well and they charged me 30 pounds for changing the booking even though I quoted the whole situation. The flight was supposed to take place 3 weeks ago. I still haven't been contacted by Wizz Air to receive my compensation and refund. I called customer support today and they just kept on asking for reference numbers and had no idea which one was correct.

I had never heard of this definition with any other airline before. What was usually accepted by other airlines as a overhead bin compatible cabine bagage size is not free at Wizz Air. See their original text: ""Großes Handgepäckstück: Falls Ihr Handgepäckstück größer als ein kleines Handgepäckstück ist, aber die Maße 56 x 45 x 25 cm nicht überschreitet, können Sie es gegen eine Gebühr mit an Bord nehmen. Es muss in das Gepäckfach passen."" So given that the world had been travelling for years with this size of bagage, every passenger that buys a ticket with Wizz and was used to take his cabin carry-on, needs to pay for it.

In airport they pulled me over and told to put the luggage in the steel box, they have. So I did and to my great surprise, they insisted, I have to pay, since the wheels are little bit out from the box (not even an inch!) Since I measured the luggage at home with proper measuring line, I insisted they show me the actual length of the box. Of course, now it turns out, this supposedly is not their job, but nonetheless I am forced to pay 40 euros on spot. To make the situation less awkward, they gave me an option, though, which was to leave the bag behind! Lucky for me, I am spot on with the terms and conditions and this was the only thing, I had to pay extra this time, but I saw few people paying ridiculous sums of money just for having online check in and no paper to go with it.

Ironically, he kept repeating the mantra of 'you will have to complain via the website'. To put this into context, I was refused a refund of just £38 for the unaffected flight which is a very small price to pay to keep a customer happy and to give me the option to rebook alternative flights.

We booked this flight on 11 February 2015 (6 months before), and paid an additional 79 Euro each for the Wizz Plus package that includes all the extras. Shortly after our booking, Wizz Air introduced seat allocation and we used the Wizz Air mobile app to choose our seats (as there was no such option on their website). This was the most tedious process: after each seat allocation the app blocked me from further actions because I had to pay 9 Euro, even though this was free-of-cost for the Wizz Plus package holders. I had to call them onto their international Customer Care number after each seat allocation to clear the bill. After we finally managed to allocate the seats, we received the email confirmation from the Customer Relations Department (Wizz Air Hungary) for our reserved seats together on the 1st row. Firstly, when we arrived to the Sofia airport, we were given two completely different to our booking seats (not even together). After showing the confirmation and the email form The Customer Relations Deptartment, the airport staff issued new boarding passes to us for seats 1F and 1E and we proceeded to the security checks etc. Upon boarding we discovered that our seats 1F and 1E were taken by other passengers with the same boarding passes as ours. Obviously those passengers refused to move and we had to be seated at the end of the plane far away from each other as the crew could not do anything and blamed ground handlers at the Sofia Airport. There were several other passengers on this flight facing the same issue (same seat allocation as other passengers), and it was very unfair and caused a chaos before take off. Passengers were still standing unseated while the plane was already moving. This completely ruined the end of our holiday as we had to travel separately for no fault of ours whatsoever. I send the detailed complaint to Customer Relations Department and also placed an official complaint using their website link. I also requested to cancel our upcoming one-way flight with Wizz Air in January 2016 from Sofia to Dubai. Since then I have sent them numerous reminders to respond, raised numerous requests online to follow up on my complaint, even called their ""Customer Care"" who could not or did not want to assist whatsoever and said that the Customer Ralations Department must have been very busy and get back to me ""shortly"".

If you're used to it and you don't expect a typical holiday flight experience, this is a good option for those on a budget. Don't think of it as a flight but more like a long distance bus ride. Here are my tips based on my experience:  Check in online, do it early enough and bring the printed ticket. If you don't they'll charge you a fortune at the airport. Don't take luggage and only one(!) small cabin bag. And make sure that your small cabin bag is soft! Many times I've seen people who had hard shell cases that wouldn't fit the steel frame at the airport by a centimeter or two. They had to pay a lot for that centimeter. Always take a soft backpack that is not stuffed to bursting point. Skip the extras like priority boarding, extra legroom or inflight snacks and drinks. My flight takes between 1.5-2 hours. Bring a book, sit, read and be the last to get in line at the gate. Why sit with crampy legs on a plane for money when it's free and comfortable right in front of the gate? And those crampy legs during the flight? I'm 193 cm tall. If I can suck it up for the duration of the flight so can you. Sitting straight to the back of the seat helps. And the same goes for onboard drinks and snacks.  This is the fastest and cheapest way for me to travel this particular route. I don't expect much from it other than that.

During my flight from Istanbul to Budapest, I tried to online checkin but the website mentioned that online checkin was not available for that route.

I was charged €40 to have my boarding pass printed at the airport (something easyjet don't do) as there was no option for electronic ticket or self service check in. I could have printed it myself before flying of course but I was travelling when I booked the flight so thought getting from the airport would be my easiest option. Then before boarding the plane, which was a complete disorganised mess, I was told my hand luggage was too big and would have to pay €70. I knew for a fact it was within the correct measurements stated on their website and even had a tape measure with me. Funnily enough it didn't fit into their little box you use to test if it's the right size but I knew it was within the correct measurements so suggested I take out my tape measure and show them. This shut the woman up as she obviously knew the test box wasn't true to he size of the overhead lockers. Eventually, after a lot of attitude from staff I got through with my bag. Like easyjet they only allow one bag, no matter how small the second is, but they were much more strict in enforcing this than easyjet.

The disorganization is what stupefies me because isn't being organized what breeds efficiency and therefore cost savings? Had us check in online and print boarding pass which makes complete sense but then we hs to go through check in to get a new boarding pass anyway- how does that make sense? Check in line is same as bag drop, so it's wildly inefficient, 45 min wait (and employment of personnel that could have been avoided!). Charging us for priority boarding but then everyone gets stuffed on the same bus so everyone had to hurl themselves to the aircraft at the same time anyway- so what am I paying for? And yes you have to hurl yourself to the aircraft because the baggage compartment for the ""priority"" seats is taken up by the luggage of the personnel so the ""priority"" passengers have nowhere to leave their luggage. Their flights are too crammed together in that there isn't enough time between the landing of the aircraft and the next takeoff so there are delays. Because organisation is awful we all get jammed into the bus to be taken to the aircraft (no aircon, bus stuffed), but the aircraft isn't ready so we sit and wait for 10min+ in the bus and struggle to breathe.

For the return journey I made sure to check in the moment I arrived in Budapest to avoid this situation again. However on the return leg, as my mum's hand luggage bag was perfectly fine for the overhead compartment but too big to fit under the seat in front she was charged £40. Whilst some may say it's our fault we didn't check the requirements, we assumed as we weren't challenged about the bag going to Budapest, we wouldn't have any problems on the way back. Also - this is a Standard hand luggage bag which my mum uses around the world without any quibbles. The customer service of the Wizz Air staff was awful. Other passengers had issues with their luggage and tickets - all had reasonable excuses, yet there was no empathy from the staff at all. My 60 year old mum needed some assistance placing her bag in the locker. The flight attendant refused. I know things like this aren't compulsory but I can't help but think that when airline staff go above and beyond (or at least appear to!) - this will encourage people to fly again with them.

It was a surprise when at the airport we were charged $50 per person for a boarding pass as I have apparently selected on-line check-in but did not complete the process.

Check-in was effective staff attentive and friendly I purchased extra legroom and there was enough space. I am based in Budapest and travel on business frequently. When flying within Europe I prefer to fly budget airlines - primarily Wizzair Ryanair to a lesser extent over legacy/full service carriers: 1) Wizzair flies early and late during the day allowing a full day of work at destination. Hate flying into destinations where budget airlines do not fly e.g. Zurich where the first flight from Budapest arrives after 11 am and the last one leaves at 5 pm. 2) Wizzair breaks down the difference between economy and business into specific services that you can purchase individually (priority boarding extra legroom lounge more luggage etc.). Thus you can travel effectively on business within Europe picking what you want for prices lower than economy ticket on legacy airlines. 3) They are cheap (for the most part). 4) They have some of latest bag drop-off times allowing one to start off for the airport later and time is money. Flying from smaller airports also means shorter check-in times (although sometimes offset by these airports being farther from cities). 5) Their policies actually make sense: I have no sympathy for those who wish to bring on board their wooden trunks and carpet bags on boards. They take up precious on space on board and slow down boarding. You should pay dearly for this or check them in!

They charged us $200 just to print out the passes ($50 each). On top of that one of the cabin bags was over the dimension so we had to fork out another $60 just to carry it our self on board. This I realize is my own mistake not to carefully read the dimensions they gave us assuming that it would be the same as rest of the airlines. Their allowable size is tiny and most of the people had to fork out extra as even a centimetre extra would not work.

We were then informed that our carry on luggage was too big and we had to pay an extra £45 each not to be checked under the plane but just to take it on board with us (making no sense to me). Why pay extra for a bag that could already be taken on. Anyway by this stage we were getting close to our boarding gate opening and closing and still had to go through security fearing even more payment of missing a flight we asked if there was anyway we could get a quicker route through security they informed us it was another 5 euro each for fast track We said we would pay to only be informed that they could only take cash which we did not have.

The real complaint I have is probably with Luton Airport - like a previous customer said I find it incredible the way the Wizz Air Passengers are treated like cattle at the check In. We are told to go to a Gate No only to be kept waiting for sometimes an hour often standing on the stairs before boarding the plane. I am sure every Wizz Air passenger has experienced this I know I have maybe about 14 or 15 times.,,3,4,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,4,0,57ca43e0-2525-4f3d-88f0-edb7a9d8f399
,Wizz Air,Economy Class,,18th December 2014,0,0,0,UnitedKingdom,8.0,yes,I flew Wizz Air from Kyiv (Zhulyany) Ukraine to Katowice Poland and I think because this is the Ukraine WizzAir which still has some 'frills'. The cabin was clean and departure prompt. Arrival was ahead of schedule. Check in baggage was included in fare. There was no passport check upon boarding in Zhulyany. Zhulyany has bus connections to central Kyiv however the bus does not go up to the terminal and as a result I had to get a bus back to the airport after getting off in a village somewhere outside of Kyiv. There was an applause upon landing which I had been told to expect in CIS countries. I think as long as you comply with the rules you have no problems. I have also flown Wizz Air from Cluj Napoca (Romania) to Luton (UK) and saw people being charged for over size hand baggage.,,4,5,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,5,0,3947a2c4-e1f6-48ee-9684-a07e4129557b

I have no objections against the flights themselves. Both flights were on time. The pilot spoke to us both times. The cabin crew was friendly and professional. I couldn't comment on food as I didn't have any. The gates are usually located at the further end of the airport but also this is normal for low cost and people have to anticipate this. I was only carrying one piece of hand luggage as allowed. Before my travel I checked on the website and my bag was within their allowed measurements. On the Luton airport no problem no bags were checked. On the way back however the issues started. I was pulled aside to try and fit it in their stand which appeared much smaller than the measurements stated on their website. There were many people with bags just as big as mine was yet only me and a couple more people were pulled aside. They let the other ones through no problem. So I was asked to pay for the excess which I did. I would only recommend it if you travel light.,,5,5,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,1,0,4987fd8b-d410-48d4-8e3f-3992d67f1a47

On the way there the plane was very comfortable good legroom with real leather seats. Besides the military- type tent used for boarding at BUD the experience was very fine. In Kiev W6 flies to Zhuliany airport which is located right in the urban area making it a really easy and painless transfer unlike KBP which is a lot more distant. On the way back plane 100% full. The pilot seemed in a bit of a haste rough braking after landing that broke the jubilant applause not a single announcement during the flight FA's (or at least one of them) very charming got offered the exit-seat despite being one of the last to board.

You get what you pay for after all. What really threw me off was the fact that a bag that was at first within their tiny small allowed luggage size grew! I was charged £35 for a bag I had very carefully measures beforehand and that was cleared on a previous flight. I can tolerate stringent rules but only when they are actually followed.

The flight itself was unremarkable and only slightly late into Luton but the boarding process was a disgrace. Called forward to the gate we were loaded onto a large Cobus transport. There was no control as to the number allowed onto the vehicle and despite a second Cobus waiting more and more people climbed aboard the first bus until we were crammed in like sardines. We were then left standing there in considerable discomfort for twenty minutes before the Cobus left for the 'plane. The second Cobus with far fewer passengers followed us and at the aircraft those second vehicle passengers were allowed to board. We stood for a further five minutes before being allowed onto the 'plane by which time the second lot of passengers had had first choice of the seats on this free-seating flight.

I flew Luton to Gdansk return. On the outbound leg leg room was poor. On the return leg it was terrible.

Very good value for money I have travelled with them a lot of times and I'm very happy to say I consider their service quite good keeping in mind that this a ULLC airline. You get what you pay for if you don't need a checked-in bag or on-board catering you don't need to spend your money on it. I have not experienced any unreasonable delay although I have travelled with them 30+ times in the last couple of years. The FA's are nice and welcoming the boarding takes place fast thanks to the small cabin bag policy and none of the seats can be reclined. The ground services are good as they use the main airport in Bucharest (OTP). Smaller airports like Treviso or Cuneo can be crowded while you are waiting to board the aircraft but this compensates with faster security checks. My best flights were from Bucharest to Madrid Barcelona Ciampino Bergamo Eindhoven Charleroi Catania Malta and I will soon travel on the new flights to Malaga and Malmo.

,Wizz Air,Economy Class,,6th September 2014,1,4,0,UnitedKingdom,4.0,no,"Flew LTN-SOF on W6 4302 26 August 2014. 21.50 dep. I did web check-in which was easy and as I was hand baggage only I could go straight to security. I had paid extra for the ""Large Hand Baggage"" and was surprised that no one seemed to be checking hand baggage sizes at the gate. They called us to the gate about 40 mins before departure. Then we stood for ages with no activity until after our Scheduled departure time and there are no seats at this gate (21) in Luton. Once boarding started it went without drama and they boarded at both front and rear steps so it was fast. I had not paid extra for Priority Boarding but was about 35-40th passenger to board so I had no problem finding a window seat or overhead locker space. The aircraft interior was clean and smart and seats comfortable enough even though they did not recline. However the seat pitch on standard seats was awful and made it very uncomfortable. I think it's a similar pitch to European charter airlines flying within Europe. We departed 30 mins late. The crew were courteous and reasonably friendly. I thought the inflight buy on board was good value. Euro 4.00 for a large (250 ml) fairly decent tasting glass of wine. (Much cheaper than in Luton airport). Despite our late departure we arrived on time. Disembarkation was swift via a one minute bus ride and then quickly through immigration and customs. Overall it was ok value for money but it was not comfortable. Though I still don't understand why they called us to the gate so early and made us all stand for so long if they were nowhere near ready for us to board.",,1,2,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,3,0,160d5a9d-f62e-4e10-92e0-10364fca2849

Went to check-in area with the same trolley that I have traveled with countless times put it in the bin for inspection and got acceptance sticker affixed on it. Agent at boarding decides to verify again and overrules his colleague at check-in. According to him height is 1cm in excess and thus charges airport hold luggage fee of 70 euro but absurdly just lets us carry it with us on board. The fact that his colleague approved it was no excuse; he was the supervisor and has the power to overrule everybody. Requests to speak to his supervisor were rejected. On return flight from Eindhoven following day same trolley goes through same inspection and is again accepted without slightest hesitation.

We paid for priority boarding and on our return flight waited in a long queue to check our bags although we had checked in online. After we had been in the queue for 30 minutes one of Wizz Air employees told us to move to the priority queue (which was much shorter) to check our bags. We left the longer queue and when we arrived at the shorter queue a very snotty employee told us to get back to the longer queue.

Check in was busy but efficient and we booked priority boarding and the option of buying an empty seat space for several of us ensuring we all had room. This is an excellent offer that may not be available on all flights but the option always remains to go for the exit seats which offer more space. All of the hassle we witnessed at the airport was due to passenger errors whether trying to book 35kg bags in or taking luggage on board that did not conform to the guidelines which are very clearly outlined on the website. Several passengers did not appear to know whether they had checked in online or not and complained when they were charged the airport fee- again very clearly expressed online.

Lots of selling to passengers mid-flight but this is as you would expect from a budget airline. I personally did not have problems with baggage allowances but took care to read the online information carefully following the negative comments on this site. Where Wizz fell down for me was in the information provided to passengers at the airport - for both the outward and return journeys there were 60 minute delays with little information forthcoming as to why. The delay on the way home in particular was shocking - passengers were actually 'boarded' through the gate when the plane had not even reached Vilnius. This meant 200 people were kept cooped up between the gate and the runway in sweltering conditions with no access to water or WC's for an hour without any information as to why.

First I had problems with my hand luggage despite me purchasing additional luggage for $160. The allowance in KG was 32kg my luggage weigh 20kg. Apparently they didn't like the size of my had luggage which weighed 3 kg as it only contained iPad travel documents and mask that I purchased in Venice. The size of the luggage is a typical suitcase for domestic flights in Australia (which btw I measured beforehand as I am very particular about things like this) which I have taken on Wizzair and Ryanair flights before without any issues. They asked me to place it into the cage and I did. It fitted except the wheels that stood above the cage. When I demanded the measuring tape to prove that the luggage is exactly the required size the Wizzair staff member raised his voice at me.

The ticket price was low and great value. Both aircraft's were less than 2 years old and beautiful Flights were on time. I paid $6 extra for priority boarding which was a great value to find a good seat. I love the fact that they allow 32 kilos (about 70 lbs) and no size limit for checked baggage (cost $40). I would fly them again any day. One other thing - I like that the seats don't recline so you don't have the seat in front of you in your face.,,4,5,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,5,0,61767c3f-2122-4e8b-8d9b-42a5941d2efd

One problem: poor ground service at FMM airport - without screen information only speaker and a person who ran from one group to another to orientate people (there was a flight to Belgrade in the same time) - I would say this was rather primitive.

We flew on this date because our original flight on June 16th was cancelled and we had to re book. Our flight from Naples was 5 hours late. The seats were not allocated so it was a scramble for seats in the economy class. Another issue is the allowed size of the luggage basically only a small soft backpack is accepted without an additional fee. Most of the passengers were told that their luggage is either too big or two heavy. We each had to pay additional 48 Euro for a small luggage. I purchased a new small luggage just for this flight had to pay anyway. I would never fly with this airline again.,,1,3,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,1,0,b1063252-472e-43ba-ae77-ac7836f89878

Eventually finding my way forward I was informed that the first three rows of seats are reserved to those paying the £7.00! The same was the case a Budapest.

In general I think Wizz Air is an ideal low cost company especially for those who prefer 100% on-line handling. If one is able to schedule their flight well in advance then the price is also unbeatable.

The pilot was a true professional landing excellent. As you can see Wizz Air can be hit and miss. To use only if you're light on luggage and able to respect the stingent rules that could easily make your ""cheap"" ticket skyrocket above the price of the one of a regular airline.

Talk about making easy things hard. Throughout the staff were unhelpful and rude - probably comes with having to deal with irate passengers daily.

The flights are cheap especially if you join their Wizzair Club the staff are for the most part friendly and helpful although the flight staff are not always too easy to understand when using English. The seats are fairly cramped but for 2.5 hours this is not a great problem the luggage allowances need to be clearly studied but an allowance of 32kilos for hold luggage is generous. Hand luggage can therefore be quite minimal. It is always best to eat and drink before the flight as in-flight refreshments seem to be one of the ways the airline makes up for their cheap flights. Arrival and departure times are normally very close to target. My only real complaint is the long wait always experienced at the Luton departure gate always having to stand while the plane is being prepared. Why not call us when they are ready to take us on board?

I always buy the extra legroom seat at the emergency exit row for a small fee (around 10 to 15 euros per flight) which also includes priority boarding - very good value as this seat is actually more comfortable than business class seats on most intra-European flights.

Staff were helpful and friendly. This is a classic Low cost carrier operation and you get what you pay for - the only problem with this kind of tarmac dash boarding is if you want to make sure you sit next to each other then you need to buy priority boarding. I had read other reports prior to the flight and wasn't looking forward to it but the experience was much better than I thought it would be. I think the problems on these airlines are caused by people who don't abide by the rules and expect a full service airline product on a low cost carrier. They do have two baggage sizes for cabin baggage and they do enforce it - measure your bag before you go to the airport and accept if its not ""small"" you will end up paying for it.

On GDN-TKU we actually paid more for one piece of luggage (15) than the cost of one passenger ticket. Flight to GDN on time. GDN-TKU took place on the day winter storm Xavier hit Poland so we really didn't know what to expect. However the flight took off about 30min delayed and landed in TKU almost on time. We believe that our WizzAir flight must have been one of the few flight that managed to take off almost on time in Gdansk that day. No worries about security during take off either.

OK it was very cheap but turned out to be very uncomfortable before we had boarded the aircraft (which did leave on time thank goodness). I have two main issues: We had booked priority boarding because we were a party of 5 with a baby of 1 year and wanted to sit together. We found that in practice this meant we could stand at the head of the boarding queue with a restless baby for about one hour. Departure gate staff made no attempt to deal with this by for example getting passengers to sit down until boarding was imminent or announcing that priority boarders could jump the queue when the gate was opened.

,Wizz Air,Economy Class,,10th November 2013,1,2,0,UnitedKingdom,1.0,no,Donetsk- Luton. This flight will make me think twice next time I may book with this airline. Once the boarding was completed we started to see the captain and two engineers coming back and forward from the flight deck. One hour later passengers were disembarked due to a technical problem. One hour later the flight was cancelled and an airport assistant said us that Wizz had no local assistance in the airport. However she would have tried to provide assistance booking in a local room. I phoned to Wizz Air customer service the phone call is chargable and four minutes cost me £4.82. The Wizz assistant said that I had two options ask a ticket refund or wait until Wednesday (three days from the flight cancellation) for the next available flight. She said that there was no guarantee of a full hotel refund. I decided to take a train overnight and go to Kiev where more flights were available. In spite the situation Wizz Air in Kiev refused to bring me in the next flight Kiev-London available in 5 hours and asked me the full cost of Euro 200.00 which I refused to pay. The airline then replied to my refund request stating that they fall within the EU regulations for some passenger rights and under the Ukraine regulations for other things like ticket refunds. So I need to ask the refund to Wizz Ukraine which I got two weeks later. The lesson learnt is that there are hidden costs which can surface when things get wrong. The entire return travel costs me Euro 285 more than planned.,,4,1,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,1,0,8d2abb47-9397-4a57-b7e5-5f0bb12bc0b4

After all the negative comments below what a surprise. No problems getting on/off the planes with unreserved seats. Both planes newish and clean. Cabin assistants did a great job especially with families politely asking singles to move in order to keep late boarding families together. Only gripe is Wizzair are inconsistent with baggage sizes. Some people being asked to pay for oversize baggage others with clearly oversize bags going through. A baguette drink and 4 bar kit-kat costs only £5 on board.

If I could walk I would rather do that than fly with them. The seats are without a doubt the absolute worst seats of any airline I have every flown on and I have been on a few. Occasionally I have had one of their aircraft with acceptable seat pitch but they seem to be fewer these days and unless you are shorter than your average 9 year old you will find the legroom horrendously uncomfortable. It seems incredible to me that its actually legal to force people to sit with so little legroom. Cabin crew are not overly friendly and English is not well spoken generally. The safety announcements are almost impossible to understand in English if you are unfortunate enough to be taking your first ever flight with them. Saying all that I have yet to be delayed on one of their flights so can't complain about that.

We had 1 booked suitcase going to Prague and we needed to carry 2 booked suitcases to come back. We had to pay an extra 65 Euros at the airport to add 1 booked suitcase.

I had a backpack on that was bigger than the size tester but was beckoned on through and not charged. One of the first of our party to get charged paid cash and was charged more than those paying by card etc. The staff were thoroughly miserable and who can blame them when they are forced to charge 80% of passengers who can fly out of the UK with a certain size back but not back? I don't think I have ever heard so much shouting and swearing and quite frankly I don't blame them at all.

,Wizz Air,Economy Class,,21st July 2013,0,0,0,UnitedKingdom,8.0,yes,LTN-OTP / TSR-LTN. LTN-OTP on new A320. However Wizz Air urgently needs to restructure their boarding system at Luton people were pushing and shoving and there was a lot of confusion and mis-communication as to where we were supposed to line up. I think Wizz Air would benefit from establishing a seat allocated boarding system like Easyjet as this would put an end to the 'free for all' pushing and shoving issue. If you travel through Luton there are delays to almost every flight there are far too many Wizz Air flights leaving and arriving at the same time and as such this airport cannot cope with the huge surge in early morning traffic. Cabin crew were helpful as always. As usual there is now very little seat pitch on their latest A320's so you might want to consider paying for an extra leg room seat as there is virtually no room for your legs. TSR-LTN: Flew back to Luton on a new A320 as on outboard flight. The way boarding was handled in Timisoara was noticeably better than we experienced in Luton. Departure was on time and like before the crew were excellent. All in all Wizz Air is a good low cost airline much better than the likes of Ryanair and we will definitely continue to fly with them on our future trips to Romania. It's a real shame that they have chosen London Luton Airport as their main UK base I seriously hope that they will consider flying from Stansted Airport in future.,,3,5,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,4,0,8e584943-3902-4057-b803-a029d511d289

No one from Wizz was there to say sorry or even offer a free bottle of water. Eventually people from the sub contractors turned up who refused to take any ownership for the delay. The airline knew there was a problem with the plane but simply lied about it at check in presumably to avoid any requirement to give us anything in the way of compensation. On the plane the captain made a nice speech apologising for our treatment but this did not extend to giving us so much as a free drink. Bottom line is that Wizz seems to do everything so cheaply that there is no- one to help if anything goes wrong with your flight. I would try and avoid Wizz in the future.

,Wizz Air,Economy Class,,14th April 2013,0,4,0,Italy,8.0,yes,Regular on MXP-BUD-MXP route. All the journey apart from one leg were on time. The aircraft's are quite new and clean. If you're lucky you can get the plane with slim seats: it will entitle you to a decent legroom otherwise with the old ones is simply inhuman. In my opinion that's the only bad point of this airline. The rules about hand luggage are not easy but once familiar is possibly to cope with. The ground staff in this respect in MXP are very tolerant while in BUD are strict and rude. If booked in advance the fares are really good and the overall service is acceptable and better than Ryanair's. Let's say if you go for a low-cost is impossible to expect a high-class level and Wizzair falls under this scheme.,,3,3,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,5,0,b8cfe3ee-6d87-465f-b24c-ef392e4a4347

I brought this to the cabin crew attention and paid £10 x 2 for my Girlfriend and I to move seats. On return trip I was stopped at gate by staff as my bag (cabin approved) was oversize and would have to pay £30. I explained that I had just flown out 2 days previous and had no problem with my bag size. She was rude unapologetic and robotic in her manner. After paying she handed me my receipt without so much as a thank you or sorry for any inconvenience. I sat twisted in the cramped seat with my right leg out onto the walkway. There was no way I was giving them another penny for extra leg room and to top it off the announcement at the start of the flight stated that 'our passengers comfort is our priority during this flight'.

Inflight service was friendly and helpful at both airports you have to jump through more hoops than a normal carrier but pay the correct fees and you'll get an easy and trouble free flight.

However on the return leg things were different. All seemed to be going very well they started checking us in an hour before the departure time and we went down to the busses for boarding (or so we thought). However we were crammed into the bendy bus. We were crammed in like sardines with small children and parents all mixed in. It was dark and cold outside and they kept us cooped up in there for over 30 mins. Away we went without a hint of explanation let alone an apology. I can only assume the way Wizzair have got round their debacle with the airport is to use their busses as waiting areas prior to boarding. It was a shame really because the other parts of the flight were perfectly acceptable and the cabin crew fine.,,1,5,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,4,0,b074b2a7-017b-4b6d-8dab-90e73355518d

Menu prices very reasonable regular flight deck announcements and no pre recorded announcements everything done by the crew except the audio safety demonstration. Again I had great difficulty understanding the English.

They confirmed our cabin bags were suitable weight and size. When we're about to board they told us they weren't suitable and had to pay 60 Euro cash or we couldn't board. Emailed WizzAir to complain and they take an unacceptable amount of time to respond. By packing so many people into the plane the legroom is uncomfortable and there isn't enough space for each persons cabin luggage to go into the overhead compartment. Works out 5 bags for each 9 seats. A cheap flight ends up being expensive when you add in the bags for checkin and the payment charges as well as the booking charges.

Its getting worse now with fees for cabin baggage Wizz are apparently the first European airline to do this. For this one hour flight I really couldn't fault Wizz Air the seats were a lot more comfortable than Ryanair. It was just a regular low cost flight as far as I am concerned.

Boarding was announced only to be followed by ground agents walking the line and selecting many to fit their bags into the 'box'. I made it with a firm boot but was disgusted to witness an elderly lady failing by a minimum margin. We all helped with plastic bags and someone found a bin liner. Result - lady lost her bag but the PR for Wizz was appalling. Note that they have now changed their baggage policy which is full of anomalies with different dimensions apparently qualifying as 'free' as well as a myriad of complications.

,Wizz Air,Economy Class,,7th October 2012,0,2,0,UnitedKingdom,1.0,no,"We fly often with Wizzair and this is purely and simply on the grounds of cost - it is the cheapest currently available. As an airline it has a truly dreadful attitude to its customers and deserves to go bust which it no doubt will in due course. A couple of examples: 1. Wizzair has routinely texted passengers warning them to arrive ""at least three hours"" before their flight ""due to congestion"" at the airport in question. This has always been untrue and merely a ruse for the company's convenience. My wife and children unwise to the deception arrived three hours before an early morning flight from Warsaw to Luton in early January and found the airport was not even open and they had to sit outside in the freezing temperature for two hours. 2. The hand luggage rule is being applied in a manner which can only be described as inhuman. On a recent flight from Warsaw-Modlin to Luton many passengers were forced to leave whole cases behind rather than pay the draconian penalty fee for being few centimetres oversized. The Wizzair staff were curt and rude and entirely indifferent to their plight.

Now you have to pay a charge for payment itself - be it credit card or bank transfer or payment at their own airport office. The cabin luggage dimensions are treated extremely strictly - 3 cm more depth at the bottom of my trolley suitcase was the reason for forcing me to check it in. But what really crossed my red line was the minimum distance between the seats on the flight from Glasgow Prestwick to Warsaw - taller people had no room for their legs only the really slim ones could open their tables in full and any movement out of/back onto the seat was a fight. Considering that with the charge for check-in luggage and all other fees the tickets bought two months before the flight were EUR 180 pp I really don't see the sense of using such a carrier in future.,,0,0,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,1,0,470080aa-0360-4571-a538-9c68e51f2998

,Wizz Air,Economy Class,,25th June 2012,0,0,0,UnitedKingdom,5.0,no,I travel regularly between Luton and Kiev. Since transferring destination airports from Borispol to Zhulyany the trip has been made so much more convenient and cheaper to get from airport to the centre of town. WizzAir has a long way to go in terms of customer satisfaction - it has appalling customer support it hides costs on its web site the aircrew seem to have to undergo a humour bypass to get their jobs. They cannot always speak sufficiently good English to give an effective safety demonstration when on-board they are very rigid regarding printing boarding passes and in Luton at least appear paranoid about the size and weight of hand luggage (the Kiev end was far better). All in all it is not a pleasant stress-free experience travelling with them but will I use them again? Yes until the new international terminal at Zhulyany airport gets spoiled by too many passengers or another better airline starts flying into Zhulyany. Then I might be able to avoid travelling from Luton which I dislike intensely.,,0,0,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,1,0,47a13c95-5360-488a-8783-705057f43aec

,Wizz Air,Economy Class,,11th June 2012,0,0,0,Australia,8.0,yes,We travelled from Luton to Targu Mures in Romania. It is a must to purchase priority check-in/seating. The queue at the regular check-in counter at Luton was unbelievable for 6am on a Sunday morning. Priority check-in allows you to go to a separate queue that is much shorter. Staff were friendly and efficient. Make sure that you only have one piece of carry on luggage. My wife and I both had a carry on bag and smaller hand bag each. We had to stuff the smaller into the larger. You must ensure that your carry on bag fits within the specified dimensions. We witnessed one poor fellow whose carry on case was within the specified dimensions except for the small wheels. He was made to pay the 50 Euro excess. Boarding was speedy - the aircraft appeared to be brand new - the inflight service ok - the flight was smooth and the exit in Romania was uneventful.

Flight delayed almost 7 hours. 3 completely different types of information given by arrogant ground crew misleading passengers. Refusing to take any responsibility and giving an 8 pound voucher Wizzair has declared the situation solved. An additional issue was a drunk passenger admittedly not the airline's fault who had to be taken off the plane adding another 45 min to the delay.

The first time also had problems with website changing title from Mrs to Mr which meant I had to call the premium rate line to get it fixed (which they did without fuss). So you need to budget for an hour or two of your time plus a five minute call to a premium rate number into the total cost. Then you may find its more cost effective to pay a higher price with another airline or just pay their airport check-in fee. In short a reasonable alternative to Ryanair but Easyjet is better at twice the price (if they serve your route).,,0,0,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,4,0,87e884e8-ca75-4a49-85c8-7a14ea673da5

Same problem on return leg. On the outward flight seat pitch was comfortable but on the return seat pitch was very cramped and uncomfortable. Luckily the plane was not full and no-one sat in the middle seat of my row but this is not ideal for a long flight. I used their minibus service from Warsaw airport to the city. As we arrived late at night and with a delay I was pleased the bus had waited. Driver friendly but drove like a maniac down long straight roads with little traffic from the airport and through a few red lights. Overall good service but would hesitate to use Wizz again because of the seat-pitch being so small.,,0,0,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,4,0,0d272c89-ff3f-43a9-9c74-5af9d67a143d

WizzAir personnel didn't know nothing and just pointed the passengers to the ticket desk. They said the reason for cancellation was airport officials were having a strike but all the other airlines were flying and there wasn't a single cancellation besides Wizz. My guess is that because the passengers for my flight were around 30 people - they decided to just cancel it. Otherwise I don't see any reasonable explanation.

Return from Bucharest Baneasa was on time but the boarding hall in this airport is a disgrace being overcrowded with few monitors (very hard to be read) and with no space for more than 250 persons so guess what happens when all the 4 gates are operating at the same time. Besides that it took 40 minutes to get through passport control and security checks. The plane to Bergamo was a new A320 with miserable leg room and hard leather seats. As on the onward trip all the announcements were pronounced so quickly that it was almost impossible to understand what they were talking about. Even the safety announcements were obviously made only because it is compulsory by law since they were just rushing to complete the sentences as soon as possible complying with the short time between bording and departure. When I fly with a low cost carrier I often wonder if the cabin crew would really be able to manage any kind of emergency since I do have the feeling the everything is speeded up to the very limit and this is against safety.

I called their premium phone line numbers at least 4 times to chase my refund - still no refund. Flight - delayed by 1.5 hours on the way out - people queuing up at the gate - no explanation offered. No drinks available on the flight.,,0,0,wizz-air,Wizz Air customer review,,,1,0,c1ceb07e-a04d-4389-ac85-dca4fe00b745
