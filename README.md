# Airline Review Analysis

This project involves analyzing customer satisfaction data for different airlines, using visualizations to uncover key trends and insights. The data was sourced from Kaggle and processed to explore factors influencing customer satisfaction over time.

## Files in the Project

This project includes the following files:

1. **`AirlineReviews.csv`**  
   Contains the raw dataset with customer reviews and satisfaction scores for various airlines. It includes details about customer experiences, ratings, and other relevant information.

2. **`cleaned_sample_data.csv`**  
   This file is the cleaned and pre-processed version of the original dataset. It has been refined by removing any inconsistencies and irrelevant data, making it suitable for analysis.

3. **`visualization.ipynb`**  
   A Jupyter Notebook that includes the code for generating various visualizations in the project. It contains steps for importing the data, analyzing it, and creating visual representations like line graphs, bar charts, histograms, and more.

## Visualizations Used in the Project

In this project, several types of visualizations were created to analyze customer satisfaction across various airlines:

1. **Line Graph**  
   The line graph visualizes trends in the overall score over the date flown, tracking changes in customer satisfaction over time. This helps in understanding how satisfaction levels evolve for customers based on when they flew.

2. **Bar Graph**  
   The bar graph compares the overall scores across different airlines, clearly showing performance differences among the airlines. It provides a straightforward comparison of customer satisfaction between airlines.

3. **Histogram**  
   The histogram shows the distribution of overall scores according to the frequency and range of satisfaction levels. This visualization helps to understand how scores are spread across different satisfaction levels.

4. **Box-Whisker Plot**  
   The box-whisker plot summarizes the distribution of overall scores, highlighting the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. This allows for a quick visual assessment of score distribution and the presence of any extreme values.

5. **Pie Chart**  
   The pie chart shows the distribution of origin country and airline, illustrating the proportion of each category within the dataset. It helps to visualize the composition of the data based on different airlines and the countries from which passengers flew.
